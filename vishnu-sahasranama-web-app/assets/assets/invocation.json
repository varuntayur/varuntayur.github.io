        "englishExplanation": "For this sacred chant, the \u0027Thousand Names of Lord Vishnu\u0027, Sri Veda Vyaasa is the divine Rishi. Great mantras of deep spiritual significance and sublime Vedic dignity are not mere poetic compositions by mortal fallible intellects. When a. mastermind through meditation transcends the lower levels of his personality and soars into the higher mental altitudes, through his contemplation, there he \u0027receives\u0027 certain \u0027revelations\u0027 that are faithfully repeated by them to the world. Such \u0027heard\u0027 statements (Srutam) alone have the power to stand against the onslaught of the intellect, the ravages of time, the forces of criticism etc. Such statements when contemplated upon by lesser seekers, they too, in the spiritual cadence of these mantras, get unconsciously uplifted into realms unknown, and there they come to live a world of experiences unfrequented by the ordinary multitudes. The \u0027author of the mantra\u0027 is thus termed in our Vedas as the \u0027Seer\u0027 (Mantra- Drashtaa). Such Rishis themselves admit that they did not manufacture, compose or create the mantra, but they had a revelation or vision (Darsanam) of the mantra. The Mantra- Drashtaa, the Rishi, is the guru of the seeker, who is seeking his path with the help of that particular mantra. The Rishi of a mantra is installed at the roof of the head and the seeker, in his seat of Vishnu-Sahasranaama-chanting, Symbolism: ... chants this mantra in his mind, and, with his right-hand thumb, middle-finger and ring-finger touches the top of his head.\n",

Therefore, to \u0027nail\u0027 it down (Keelakam) and establish it in our comprehension, this mantra conceives (\u0027udbavah\u0027) the Power as the Lord, who bears the Conch (\u0027shanka\u0027), the Sword, named Nandaka, and the Discus (\u0027chakra\u0027). This is only to show how the total cosmic Power, expressed in terms of our present understanding as creation, sustenance, and destruction, is but a manifestation of the Lord. The conch (Sankha) represents the \u0027call\u0027 of the Reality, the Lord\u0027s own declarations stated in the scriptures. Nandaka, the sword that punishes to bring joy (Nandana) into the community and the destruction, without which evolution is impossible, is represented by the concept of the Discus (Chakra). Here it is also to be noted that the blowing or the conch represents speech; wielding the sword represents action and the discus that takes off from Him at His will, represents his thoughts. Thus this great Power installed at the navel expresses itself in the world through speech, action and thought.\nSymbolism: To conceive fully this form is to hold firmly the Lord\u0027s own feet, and, therefore, when this mantra is mentally chanted, the fingers move away from the navel, and with both hands the seeker touches his own feet. Here it is to be carefully noted how: the Guru is kept at the roof of the head, the Veda (metre) in the mouth, the Lord in the heart, the Power in the navel and, thereby, the seeker himself becomes so sacred that he prostrates unto himself by holding his own feet.\n",

But the seeker himself has no power to protect, and so, he invokes the very weapon (Astra) of Vishnu, the protector of the world, to stand by for the defence of the sanctified bosom. Saarga is the name of the Bow (Dhanus) of Vishnu and the Mace (Gadaa) is another of his weapons. These two form the artillery of defence; which are manned by the Lord himself.\nSymbolism: At this moment when this mantra is mentally chanted, it is significant that the student lifts the palm away from the feet, and with the stretched out index and middle fingers of the right palm snaps them on the open left palm.\n",

The procreated world of endless variety has only one Eternal Father, and this source is immaculate Bliss. When this is chanted the seeker installs the Bliss Infinite at the very place of procreation in himself.

To be truthful and ever to seek the great Reality (Ritam), to discriminate and see the play of the Lord in all situations (Su-Darsanam), and to control the very instrument of the time (Kaala), which is intellect in the seeker, is to guard the frontiers of one\u0027s spiritual world, against the hoards of inimical forces.

        "englishExplanation": "Having thus installed through sankalpa the Lord in himself and having come under the protecting wings of the mighty lord, here is the declaration how he is going to employ himself in it. He is going to engage himself (Viniyoga) in japa (jape) of the \u0027Thousand Names of Lord\u0027 (\u0027sahasra-naama\u0027). Now the question is: with what motive should be undertake this chanting? The answer is in the very statement that it is only for the grace (Preetyarthe) of Sree Maha Vishnu. Symbolism: After chanting this declaration in the mind, the saadhaka, takes a spoon of water (Teertham) in his right palm and pours it on the floor in front of him. A true seeker is not desire-ridden for material satisfaction, and, therefore, he can have only one intention-the grace of lord, which will manifest in him as contemplative power. These twelve \u0027slogans\u0027 are chanted for invoking and installing these refreshing and spiritually benign ideas on the limbs of the devotee himself. At this juncture this makes him inspired sufficiently for higher meditation upon the truth as indicated and directed by the thousand terms in Sahasranaama. This beautiful subjective ritual is known as \u0027Installation on the limbs\u0027 (Anga-nyaasa). Not only that the student temporarily discovers a new surge of inspiration, but even beginners feel highly relieved, at least temporarily, from the load of his senses of \u0027sins\u0027. When this is properly performed with a right attitude and devotion, the student gains identification (saaroopya) with the Lord of his heart, at the outer levels of his personality.\n",
