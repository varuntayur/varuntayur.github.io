      "**Visvam**\nHe whose manifestation is the whole universe of forms: the Viraat-Purusha. The cause is always present in the effects and as such, That Form from which the whole universe has emerged out can only be its own manifestation. The whole cosmos of gross forms is His own expression, and therefore, He is called Viraatpurusha. \u0027Sa eva Sarva- Bhootaatmaa Visvaroopo Yato-Avyayah\u0027. The Sanskrit term Visvam comes from the root Vis, meaning to enter: Thus it means He who has created and entered into the entire universe, as the All-Pervading Reality. It can also mean, That into which the entire universe has entered to remain therein established. In the Upanishads also we have assertions of similar ideas. It is only when intellectually, we view the Lord that we come to recognize Him as the \u0027cause\u0027 for the universe. When viewed through contemplation, since the effect is nothing other than the cause, there can be no world other than Him. In fact, there is nothing other than the Supreme. In the Mandukya Upanishad we read \u0027Omkaara Evedam Sarvam\u0027. In Geeta \u0027OM ltyekaaksharam Brahma\u0027.",
      "",
      "\n**Vishnuh**\nThe term Vishnu is dissolved as Veveshti Vyaapnoti iti Vishnuh-That which pervades everywhere is Vishnu. That which has the nature of pervasiveness is Vishnu. He is the one who pervades all and nothing ever pervades Him. \u0027Eesaavaasyam Idam Sarvam\u0027-All this is indwelt, pervaded by the Lord. This very same idea is described in the typical style of the Puranas, in the incarnation of the Lord as Vaamana, the short-boy (Vamana), who, with His three feet, measured the entire universe. Because of this act, the Lord got the name Vishnu, says Mahaabhaarata. Vishnu Purana (3-1) says: The root Vis means \u0027to enter\u0027. The entire world of things and beings is pervaded by Him and the Upanishad emphatically insists in its mantra \u0027whatever that is there is the world of change\u0027. Hence it means that He is not limited by space (Desa), time (Kaala) or substance (Vastu).",
      "",
      "\n**Vashatkaarah**\nIn the ritualistic portion of the Vedas, we find many mantras ending with \u0027vashat\u0027 and they are used in pouring devoted and dedicated oblations. Thus the term Vashatkaara means: He who is invoked, and for propitiating whom, the oblations are poured in Vedic ritualism, using mantras ending with vashat. Also, Vashatkaara can mean yajna in its association and thus the term in its suggestion can signify \u0027He who is of the form of the Yajna\u0027. In the Upanishads also we find this meaning endorsed when the Upanishad mantra says: \u0027Yajno vai Vishnuh\u0027 - Yajna itself is Vishnu.",
      "",
      "\n**Bhoota-bhavya-bhavat-prabhuh**\nHe who is the Lord (Prabhu) of the Past (Bhooita), the Future (Bhavya) and the Present (Bhavat). Time is the concept of the intellect; it expresses itself in the interval between experiences. Experiences are registered as thoughts and thoughts are ever-changing. This very change is known and experienced by us. The knower of the change must be something other than the change. Thus, He who is the Illuminator of all changes, meaning the Consciousness (Aatman) is the Lord Vishnu. He is the One who is not conditioned by time.",
      "",
      "\n**Bhoota-krit**\nThe Creator (Krit) of all creatures (Bhoota). This word can be dissolved in two ways: (a) One who creates the creatures (Bhootaani Karoti iti Bhoota- Krit) or (b) One who annihilates all creatures (Bhootaani Krindati iti Bhoota-krit). In both these cases, Brahman, the Supreme is the One Reality that seems to function as the Creator, Sustainer or Destroyer, when He functions through different gunas in the Total-Mind. Functioning through a preponderance in Rajoguna, He becomes the \u0027Creator\u0027; through Sattvaguna the \u0027Sustainer\u0027, and through Tamoguna, He Himself expresses as the \u0027Destroyer\u0027. Extra comments: Subjectively, the Atman functioning through my own mind and intellect is I, the individuality. My personality entirely depends upon the quality and texture of my own thoughts. I myself become according to the moods of my mind the creator, sustainer and annihilator of my world of experiences. He who manifests and functions, in these three aspects, is the Supreme Vishnu.",
      "",
      "\n**Bhoota-bhrit**\nOne who nurtures (\u0027brith\u0027) and nourishes all beings (living creatures: \u0027bhoota\u0027) in all their attitudes is this Great Reality and, therefore, He is called the Bhoota Bhrit. In Geeta there is an elaborate description of this idea in the l5th Chapter where the Lord points out how, He, as the light in the sun, fertility in the earth, growth in the plants, nourishment in food, heat in fire, -becomes Himself the \u0027eater\u0027, and, therefore, how He Himself presides over all the functions of the body and mind, and apparently nurtures and nourishes the creatures, who are in fact nothing other than Himself.",
      "",
      "\n**Bhaavah**\nOne who \u0027becomes\u0027 (Bhavati iti Bhaavah) Himself into the movable and the Immovable beings and things in the world. He is the Pure Existence in all the sentient organisms and the insentient objects in the universe. Hence He is indicated by the term Bhaavah.",
      "",
      "\n**Bhootaatmaa**\nHe is the Aatman (soul) of all the beings (\u0027bhoota\u0027): The very \u0027Be\u0027 in the living beings. Just as the same universal space manifests in all rooms as the room-space, so the Infinite Life manifesting through any given vehicle is called the Aatman of the vehicle. It is well known that space everywhere is one and the same; so too, the One Reality sports as though different Aatmans. This One Universal Soul is called in Vedanta the Supreme Brahman (Para-Brahman) .In Bhaagavata, the Lord is addressed as \u0027You are the One Self in all living creatures ever illumining all their experiences.\u0027\u0027 In Kathopanishad: \u0027The One enchanting Truth that revels in every form manifesting in plurality\u0027.",

      "**Poota-atmaa**\nOne with an extremely Pure (Pootam) Essence; One who is not affected the least by the impurities of Maayaa. The Self is beyond all vaasanaas and, therefore, He cannot be affected by anyone of the manifestations of Maayaa such as thoughts of the intellect, emotions of the mind or the perceptions of the body. Immaculate is ever the Self, and so He is termed as the Pure Self (Poota-Aatmaa).",
      "\n**Parama-atmaa**\nThe Supreme, meaning that which transcends all limitations and imperfections of matter: in short, the Transcendental Reality. The Spirit is other than matter, and that in its presence, the vestures of matter, borrowing their dynamism from Him, play their parts rhythmically at all times. This has been the assertion found chorusly repeated in all the Upanishads and in the entire Vedantic literature. Sankara in Aatma Bodha points out that the Self is other than the three bodies and that He functions in the microcosm as a king in the nation. It was also said therein that matter borrows its energy from the Spirit and continues its activity \u0027as the world from the Sun\u0027. Kathopanishad and the Geeta guide us from the outer levels of our personality, stage by stage, into the inner-most sanctum, and there, the teachers declare, is He the Infinite, transcending all, reigning in His own glory. \u0027In short, that which remains other than the cause and effect-Maayaa and matter-is He, the Parama Aatman. In Vishnu Purana this Supreme is glorified as Maha Vishnu (Paramaatmaa)\u0027-Vishnu Purana 6.4.10...",
      "\n**Muktaanaam paramaa gatih**\nHe who is the final Goal (\u0027parama gathi\u0027), that is reached by all the liberated souls (\u0027mukta\u0027). The limitations and bondages lived through by man are in fact the destiny of the matter vestures. Through delusion of non-understanding, we identify with them and come to suffer the consequent sense of imperfections. To liberate ourselves from the thraldom of matter is to realize the Self. Hence the Truth is defined as the Supreme Goal of the emancipated. This \u0027Goal\u0027 to be attained is called as \u0027Gati\u0027 in Sanskrit, \u0027The Supreme Goal\u0027 (Paramaa Gatih) would necessarily be then that Goal, having reached which, there is no return: \u0027There where having gone, men never return, That sacred place is My seat\u0027-Geeta Ch. 15. St. 6. In Geeta. (Ch. 8. St. 6) even more explicitly the same idea has been asserted by Sri Krishna when He says: \u0027O Son of Kunti, having reached Me, there shall be no more any re-birth\u0027. Again, He defines the final Goal as \u0027That having reached no return again\u0027 – Geeta Ch. 15, st.4.",
      "\n**Avyaah**\n\u0027Vyaya\u0027 means destruction; destruction cannot be without change; therefore, that which is \u0027without destruction\u0027 (Avyayah) is the changeless. The Indestructible, and therefore, changeless, can never have any modifications (Parinaama). For, modification is but the death of a previous condition and the birth of a new condition. The Eternal and the Immutable (Avyayah) is the Supreme Sat-chit- aananda, and every other thing and being come under the hammer or change. The medium in which all these changes are sustained is Brahman, the Immutable. The Upanishads glorify Him as \u0027Ajaro Amaro Avyayah\u0027-without old age, death or change.",
      "\n**Purushah**\nOne who dwells in the Fort-city (Puri sete iti Purushah). Herein metaphorically the Rishis conceive our body as a fortress with nine gate-ways-\u0027Nava Dvaarc Pure Dehee\u0027-(Geeta Ch. 5, St. 13) -and declare the One who rules within it, like a king, is the Self. This term can also be dissolved in two more different ways giving more and more suggestions to the nature of the Self. Thus, Purusha can mean \u0027That which was before all creatures\u0027 -Puraa Aaseet iti Purushah or it can be \u0027One who completes and fulfils the Existence everywhere\u0027, meaning, without whom Existence is impossible (Poorayati iti Purushah). This Aatman remains in the bodies of living creatures as their individuality (Jeeva) and in all the activities, physical, mental and intellectual, Aatman is not in fact involved but He is therein only an observer of all that is happening. This will become clear in the following discussion.",
      "\n**Saakshee**\nWitness. In every day life he is a witness who without any mental reservation or personal interest observes and watches what is happening in a given field of experience. \u0027Saakshaad Drashtari Saakshee syaad-Amarakosa. \u0027The \u0027Knower\u0027 in every bosom is the same Supreme Self\u0027, says Lord Krishna (Geeta Ch. 13, St. 3). Though thus Consciousness illumines everything, It is only a Witness, as It knows no change. Just as the sun illumines every thing in the world and yet the Sun is not affected by the condition of the things it is illumining, so too Vishnu, the Supreme, illumines all, without Itself undergoing any change. According to Paanini Sutras the word Saakshee is derived from \u0027Sa +akshi\u0027, meaning \u0027direct perceiver\u0027.",
      "\n**Kshetrajnah**\nOne who knows the body and all the experiences from within the body, is the Knower-of-the- field, Kshetrajnah. As Brahmapurana would put it: Bodies are \u0027fields\u0027 and the Atman illumines them all without an effort, and therefore, is called Knower-of-the-field, Kshetrajnah\u0027.",
      "\n**Aksharah**\nlndestructible: things which are finite are necessarily conditioned by time and space; the Infinite is unconditioned, and so It is Aksharah. Since It is Indestructible, It cannot come under the methods of universal destruction arising from nature or through the wilful actions of man. \u0027It cannot be cleaved by instruments of destruction, nor can fire burn It, nor water drench It, nor air dry It\u0027-(Geeta Ch. 2, St. 23). It is also indicated that the Supreme Brahman is the Akshara-\u0027Aksharam Brahma Paramam\u0027 -(Geeta Ch. 8, St. 3). Please note that in the stanza there is the extra word \u0027only\u0027 (Eva) used, indicating that Kshetrajnah is the Aksharah; there is no difference between them both: the \u0027Knower-of-the-field\u0027 and the \u0027field\u0027.\n"

      "**Svayambhooh**\nThe one who manifests Himself from Himself is considered as self-made. Everything born or produced must have a cause. The Supreme is the cause from which all effects arise, and Itself has no cause. This un- caused Cause-of-all, this Ultimate Cause, with reference to which every thing else is considered as \u0027effects\u0027 is in itself the Absolute Cause. This idea is indicated by the term Self-made (Svayambhooh).",
      "\n**Shambhuh**\nHe who brings Auspiciousness- both inner goodness and outer prosperity to His devotees. Sambhuh is one of the famous names of Lord Siva. By using this term in invoking Vishnu, by its suggestion, it declares that Vishnu and Siva are not two Divine Entities, but they are both manifestations of the One Essential Reality.",
      "\n**Aadityah**\nThe Truth (Purusha) that glows with a golden splendour in the solar system is called Aadityah. There are twelve Aadityas and of them One is called Vishnu. Krishna Himself declares, \u0027I am Vishnu among the Aadityas\u0027 -Aadityaanaam Aham Vishnuh- (Geeta Ch. 10, St. 21). The word Aaditya can mean \u0027Son of Aditi\u0027-signifying the one who was born as the son of Aditi in His Vaamana incarnation. The term Aadityah can also mean in Sanskrit \u0027One who is like the sun\u0027. The Sun is the one who illumines all, and every living creature draws its nurture and nourishment directly or indirectly always from the sun alone. In the same way Brahman is the one Sun in the universe of living creatures illumining all experiences of all creatures.",
      "\n**Pushkaraakshah**\nOne who has eyes (\u0027akshah\u0027) like the lotus (\u0027pushkara\u0027). Joy and Peace in the bosom of an individual are expressed in the world outside at no other point so vividly as in the eyes. The One, whose inner peace and joy, beaming out through His eyes, bring into the devoted hearts all the aesthetic beauty and romantic thrills of seeing a lotus dancing in the breeze, In short, the term indicates the Lord who with His beautiful looks, magically lifts all the sorrows in the devotee\u0027s heart and fills it with Peace, Joy and Perfection.",
      "\n**Mahaasvanah**\nOne who possesses thundering (\u0027mahaa\u0027) voice of compulsion: \u0027Svana\u0027 means \u0027sound\u0027. One whose \u0027call\u0027 is thundered in all hearts, familiarly known as the \u0027compelling whisper\u0027 of the Higher. Or, Svanam can also mean \u0027breath\u0027; and so, the term can mean, \u0027He whose great breath is the very Vedas\u0027. \u0027Thus, O Maitreyee, this has been breathed forth from this great Being what we have as Rigveda. Yajurveda\u0027 -Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad (4.4.10). In the Spiritual literature of India we often read Vedas described as His breath; He breathed out the Vedas (Nih-svasitam).",
      "\n**Anaadi-nidhanah**\nOne who has neither (\u0027an\u0027) birth (Aadi) nor death (Nidhanum). Thus One who is changeless is Anaadi-Nidhanam; for, any change should include the death of an old condition and the birth of newer condition. To the Immortal and the Immutable, change is impossible.",
      "\n**Dhaataa**\nOne who is the Substratum for the world of names and forms. And who supports all fields of experiences in all. He who is the screen for the cinema of empirical experiences\u0027 (Visvam).",
      "\n**Vidhaataa**\nThe One who is the Dispenser of all \u0027fruits-of-actions\u0027. In the Karma-kaanda portion of the Vedas, Eesvara is described as the Dispenser of fruit (Karma- phala-daataa Eesvarah). He is the Lord who is behind this universe of scientific truths and rhythm. He is the One who has not only ordered the laws of the nature, but he is the one afraid of whom, the phenomena dare not disobey his laws anywhere at any time. The light of the sun, the heart is the fire, the sweetness in the sugar, the pains in the sin and the joy s in goodness, are all their \u0027nature\u0027 and none dare ever disobey these laws. The one who is thus the unquestionable law behind the entire universe of laws is Vidhaata.",
      "\n**Dhaatur-uttamah**\nthe fundamentals (\u0027dhaatu\u0027) that form the reinforcement on any existent thing are called Dhaatu. In science of life, as explored by the Rishis, all corporal forms have risen form and exist as composed of some definite \u0027elemental factor\u0027 called the Dhaatus. Of the end less varieties of Dhaatus available in existence, the subtlest Dhaatu, without which no existence, is ever possible, is the chit Dhaatu, and this is the Dhaatu-ruttamah. Though very rarely, we do find some commentators splitting this word into two as Dhaatu and uttama. But in the majority of the cases we find it taken to form one term and explained as \u0027the subtlest of the Dhaatus\u0027.\n"

      "**Aprameyah**\nHe, who cannot be defined and explained in terms of any logical term of reference with other things should necessarily be inexpressible. A thing that can be directly perceived (Pratyaksha) can be desired, certain other things, which we may not directly perceive, but can be infer (anumaama) them from data available. And there are yet things which can be brought home to the listener by describing them in terms of similar other objects (Upamaa). Since the infinite has no \u0027Properties\u0027. It cannot be perceived, nor can It be \u0027understood through inference.\u0027 Nor even explained in terms of similar or dissimilar things.\u0027 Hence the supreme Reality, Vishnu, is called as Aprameyah. We can experience him only by ending all sense of separativeness and becoming one with Him.",
      "\n**Hrisheekesah**\nIn the Puranic literature the meaning of the term is \u0027close-cropped\u0027 or \u0027One who has coiled up his locks of hair\u0027 (Hrissheeka+Eesa). The term \u0027Hrisheeka\u0027 is an absolute one now, and it means the \u0027sense organs\u0027. The Aatman, the self as Consciousness is the one who gives light to all sense organs and, therefore, it is the lord of all sense organs. This lord is Vishnu. The obsolete word Hrisheeka also means the \u0027rays\u0027 or that which gives the joy\u0027. Thus the term Hrisheekas can mean \u0027the Lord of the rays\u0027: the sun and moon. This way interpreted, commentators point out that the term Hrisheekesah means He who has Himself becomes the Sun and the Moon. In His manifestation as the Sun and the Moon, the Lord Himself whips the world to wakeful activities and sends the world to sleep and rest. Thus Hrisheekesa in its deeper significance, is, to all contemplative hearts, the Lord, who becomes Himself the world, exhausts Himself in His activities, and ultimately packs His toys and goes to rest at the time of dissolution.",
      "\n**Padmanaabhah**\nOne from whose navel (\u0027nabhi\u0027) springs the Lotus (\u0027padma\u0027), which is the seat of the four-faced Creator, Brahmaaji. Lotus in Hinduism represents Truth or any of Its manifested powers. The creative faculties in man flow from the navel area (center: naabhi), and manifests as the \u0027four-faced\u0027 inner equipment (Antahkarana) constituted of the mind, intellect, Chit and ego. In the Yoga-sastras, we find a lot of details regarding this concept. According to them every \u0027idea\u0027 springs from Him (Paraa), and then at the navel area, each of them comes to be \u0027perceived\u0027 (Pasyantee). Thereafter they play in the bosom as thoughts (Madhayamaa), and at last they are expressed (Vaikharee) in the outer fields-of –activity. In this discussion-upon the evolutionary stages through which every \u0027idea\u0027 becomes an \u0027action\u0027 – we gather a clearer insight into the meaning of the symbolism of \u0027the Creator seated on the lotus\u0027, which springs forth from the navel of the Lord, the Supreme Vishnu.",
      "\n**Amaraprabhuh**\nThe Lord (\u0027prabhu\u0027) of the Immortals (\u0027a-mara\u0027), the Devas. The Denizens of the Heavens, including all the office bearers therein (Dikpaalakas etc.) along with Indra, are called \u0027Devas\u0027, and they enjoy in their heavenly state a relative immortality. The devas live and continue functioning till the great dissolution-the Sleep of the Creator. Compared with the short span of the existence of man on this globe, the aeons through which the Devas live can be considered as end- less or immortal. One who serves them with His might, giving protection and security to all creatures, is called, therefore, Amaraprabhuh.",
      "\n**Visvakarmaa**\nThe very creator-of the world-of-objects, of all equipments-of-experiences, and of all experiences in all bosom-is called the Visva-Karmaa. Herein the Infinite Lord is but a Witness of all that is happening and though the experienced world is sustained in Him, He is not involved in the imperfections or mortality, that are happening all around at all times in the Visvam. \u0027They are in Me, I am not in them\u0027-Geeta.",
      "\n**Manuh**\nThe term means One who has the ability to reflect upon the Higher (Mananaseelah Manuh). Manu also means mantra and so, as applied to the Lord, it can mean as the One who has manifested Himself in the form of the Vedic mantras.",
      "\n**Tvashtaa**\nOne who makes gross things of huge dimensions into minutest particles. At the time of the world\u0027s dissolution, the entire gross-world folds back into its subtler elements until at last pure objectless space alone comes to remain.",
      "\n**Sthavishthah**\nlt is the superlative degree of gross (sthoola) and thus \u0027the Supremely gross\u0027 is the subtlest Reality. The contradiction that it contains is itself its vigour and beauty. The Infinite as the subtlest is All-Pervading in Its own nature. It is this Maha- Vishnu who has Himself become the entire universe of gross things and beings. Just as all waves are the ocean, the total world of gross things is itself the form of Vishnu. In His cosmic form, Narayana had manifested to Arjuna in he Geeta. There the words of Arjuna\u0027s chant will clearly bring home to us that the entire gross world is ever His own Divine form.",
      "\n**Sthaviro Dhruvah**\nThe Ancient (Sthavirah) and the Motionless or firm (Dhruvah). He is called the \u0027Ancient\u0027 because the very first \u0027unit of time\u0027 itself had risen from Him. He was the progenitor of the very concept of Time in us. Therefore, \u0027Time\u0027 cannot condition Him. Thus He becomes the most Ancient. He is the \u0027Firm Truth\u0027; nothing that happens in the phenomenal world can affect Him at any time.\n"

      "**Agraahyah**\nThat which cannot (\u0027a\u0027) be perceived (\u0027graahyah\u0027) through the play of the sense organs; in short, that which is not an \u0027object\u0027 of perception, but which is the very \u0027subject\u0027-who is the Perceiver in all that is perceived. The \u0027subject\u0027 can never become the \u0027object\u0027, and hence Truth is something that the sense organs cannot apprehend, as they do any other sense-objects. He is the one \u0027subject\u0027 ever-perceiving all objects, through all sense-organs of all living creatures, everywhere, at all times. The Lord is the \u0027subject\u0027, not only in the sense organs, but He is the \u0027feeler\u0027 in the mind and the \u0027thinker\u0027 in the intellect. And thus the sense organs cannot perceive It, nor the mind feel It, nor the intellect apprehend It; says the Upanishad, \u0027That from which words retire unapproached along with the mind\u0027 is the Supreme. Hence He is Agraahya-Imperceptible and Incomprehensible. Kenopanishad is very clear and emphatic: \u0027That which the eyes cannot perceive, but because of which eyes are perceiving, understand That to be Brahman (Maha Vishnu) and not that which you here worship.\u0027",
      "\n**Saasvatah**\nThat which remains at all times the same is the Permanent, That which is permanent, should remain Changeless in all the three periods of time. In short, He is unconditioned by time. The Supreme Consciousness Itself is the very Illumminator of Time, and the Illuminator can never be affected by what It illumines. This changeless reality is Vishnu.",
      "\n**Krishnah**\nThe word Krishna means in Sanskrit \u0027the dark\u0027. The Truth that is intellectually appreciated, but spiritually not apprehended, is considered as \u0027veiled behind some darkness\u0027. The root Krish means Existence (Sattaa) and na means Bliss (Aananda). So says Vyasa in Mahabharata, Udyoga Parva 70, 5. Therefore Krishna (Krish+na) means Existence- Bliss (Sattaa-Aananda). Thus, the very name divine, \u0027Krishna\u0027, represents the Supreme Paramaatman. Or, because of His dark-blue complexion He is called as Krishna. Mahabharata Santi Parva 343 says, \u0027As My colour is dark-blue, I am called Krishna, O Arjuna.\u0027 In Mahabharata, we find Krishna explaining Himself to Arjuna \u0027when the earth becomes shelled in by its hard crux I shall turn myself into an iron plough-share and shall plough the earth. Apart from the above meaning Krishna also means the Enchanter of all His devotees (Aakarshana). Truth is One which irresistibly attracts everybody towards Itself. Commentators have interpreted this significance in a more attractive context. They conclude that Krishna means One who sweeps away the sins in the heart of those who meditate upon Him. Truth has got a magnetism to attract to Itself all the ego and ego-centric passions of the individual. In this sense viewed, we need not consider Krishna as a deity of the farmyard in the agricultural estates. The Lord ploughs the hard stupidities in us and prepares the heart-field, weeding out all the poisonous growths of sin, and cultivates therein-pure Bliss which is of the nature of Reality.",
      "\n**Lohitaakshah**\nRed-eyed. Very often we find descriptions in the Puranas, where the Lord is explained as having eyes like the red-lotus (Hibiscus). Generally the ruddy eyes represent anger and the incarnations are taken for the purpose of destroying the evil and so His anger is towards the evil-minded materialists who live ignoring the higher values of life.",
      "\n**Pra-tarda-nah**\nThe root Tarda means \u0027destruction\u0027 and with the prefix Pro the root (Pra-tarda) means \u0027supreme destruction\u0027. One who does this total destruction (Pratardanah) is the Lord in the form of Rudra at the time of the great dissolution (Pralaya).",
      "\n**Prabhootah**\nThe term means \u0027born full\u0027 or \u0027ever-full\u0027. He is ever-full and perfect in His Essential Nature, as the Transcendental Reality, or even when He manifests in the form of His various incarnations. Especially in His chief and glorious incarnation as Lord Krishna, He proved Himself to be ever full with His Omnipotency and Omnisciency.",
      "\n**Tri-kakub-dhaama**\nOne who is the very foundation or support (Dhaama) of the three (\u0027tri\u0027) quarters (Kakubh). We find this is generally commented upon and described as \u0027all quarters, in the three realms above, below and middle.\u0027 Viewing this from the platform of Vedanta, He must be considered by us as the three Planes-of -Consciousness-the waking (Jaagrat), the dream (Svapna) and the deep-sleep (Sushupti) conditions. The fourth Plane-of-Consciousness (Tureeya) is the Substratum for all the other three planes.",
      "\n**Pavitram**\nOne who gives purity to the heart. To the seekers who are meditating upon Him, He gives inner purity, and hence He is known as Pavitram. Or, the term Pavi means; the weapon vajra (thunderbolt). One who saves (\u0027tram\u0027) his devotees from the thunderbolt of lndra is Pavitram. This can also be interpreted as the \u0027giridhara\u0027 episode where the lord saves his devotees from Indra\u0027s wrath. The thunderbolt is described as an instrument made out of the bone of sage Dadheechi. Indra is the Lord of the lndriyas. In Vedanta Indra signifies the mind. Mind\u0027s cross purposes, confusions, intellectual compromises and the consequent self- cancellation of our mental powers (Sankalpa-Vikalpa) can be the great thunderbolt of the mind with which Indra (mind) can destroy in no time all the acquired tapas of the saadhaka. Deep devotion, ardent meditation and firm faith in the Lord Vishnu save the saadhaka from all such mental storms and, therefore, the Lord acquires the significant name Pavitram",
      "\n**Param Mangalam**\nMangalam is that which not only removes the dark pains of evil, but brings the bright joys of merit. Param Mangalam is Supreme Mangalam, and It can be none other than He, by whose mere remembrance all inauspiciousness gets lifted up and all Auspiciousness comes to flood our hearts The Upanishad declares. \u0027May That Brahman-who removes all inauspiciousness in man and gives man all auspiciousness, by a mere remembrance of Him -give us all auspiciousness.\n"

      "\n**Praanadah**\nOne who gives (Dadaati) the Praanas to all. The term Praanas used in philosophy indicated \u0027all manifestations of Life in a living body\u0027. The Source of Life from which all dynamic activities in the living organisms of the world flow out, meaning, That from which all activities emerge out is Praanadah. Taittireeya Upanishad (2- 7) exclaims: \u0027Who could then live. who could breath\u0027 if He be not every- where.\u0027",
      "\n**Praanah**\nThat which sustains is Praana and that which has got Praana functioning in it is called a Praanee. Since the Lord is termed as this very same Praana, it means by its suggestion that He is One who ever lives. The Immortal and the Eternal is Praanah. The term can also mean that which gives Life-impulse even to the air; the capacity to sustain life in the atmosphere flows from Him alone. In the Kenopanishad we read the Supreme \u0027Defined\u0027 as the \u0027Praana of Praanas\u0027 (Praanasya Praanah).",
      "\n**Jyeshthah**\nOlder than all. The Infinite is That which was even before the very concept of space (Aakaasa) came into existence. The term is the superlative degree of the Aged. In short, the import of this term is the same as the more familiar term used in our sastras, the Ancient (Sanaatanah).",
      "\n**Sreshthah**\nThe most Glorious One: Here again it is the superlative degree of glorious, Sreyah.",
      "\n**Prajaapatih**\nThe Lord (Pati) of all living creatures (Prajaah) .The term Prajas means \u0027Children\u0027. Therefore Prajaapati means the Great Father, to whom all beings in the living kingdom are His own children, In this sense, the term connotes One, who, as the Creator, creates all creatures.",
      "\n**Hiranyagarbhah**\nOne who dwells in the womb (garbha) of the world (Hiranya). The Upanishad declares: \u0027All these are in-dwelt by the Lord.\u0027 The \u0027Golden Universe\u0027 is an idiom in Sanskrit where \u0027gold\u0027 means \u0027objects of fulfilment and joy\u0027. One who dwells in them all is Hiranyagarbhah. The term can also mean as He who, having become first the Creator, has come to he considered as the womb of all objects.",
      "\n**Bhoogarbhah**\nOne who is the very womb of the world (Bhooh) The One from whom the world has emerged out. In the Cosmic Form of the Lord, this world occupies an insignificant though sacred portion, just as the foetus in the womb, constantly and lovingly nurtured and nourished by the very Essence in the mother. Or, Bhooh \u003d the earth: the divine consort of Hari: Garbha \u003d Protector.",
      "\n**Maadhavah**\nThe Lord of Maayaa, Spouse of Mahaalakshmee. Or, the term can signify the One who is ultimately experienced through a diligent practice of \u0027Madhu technique\u0027: the very famous Madhu Vidyaa of the Chandogya Upanishad. The term Maadhavah can also mean One who is the Silent (Mauni); who is ever the Non-interfering Observer, the Silent Witness of the physical, mental and intellectual activities in the realm of change. To put it in one word, He is the One whom the seeker experiences when he has stilled his mind which has been purified by Yoga practices.",
      "\n**Madhusoodanah**\nOne who destroyed the great demon Madhu. The story of Vishnu destroying these two demons, Madhu and Kaitabha, is a story of secret suggestions in Mahabharata. Madhu also means in Veda (Madhu\u003dhoney) as the fruits of actions (Karma-phala). Actions leave impressions and these sensuous Vaasanaas are destroyed by meditations on the Reality and so the Supreme gathers to Itself the name Madhusoodanah: \u0027the Destroyer of Vaasanaas.\u0027\n"

The manifested powers of Life express themselves in every intelligent man as the power of action in the body (Kriyaa Sakti), the power of desire in the mind (Icchaa Sakti) and the power of knowledge in the intellect (Jnaana Sakti). All these three powers are manifestations of Him, and since He is the One everywhere, He is the total mighty power-the Great Vishnu.",
      "\n**. Vikramee**\nOne full of prowess (Vikrama), courage, daring. Or, it can be One who has \u0027Special foot steps\u0027. This term commemorates how the Lord, as Vamana, measured with His tiny three steps all the three worlds.",
      "\n**. Dhanvee**\nLord Vishnu\u0027s Divine Bow is called \u0027Saarnga\u0027 and it is described as the mightiest among the weapons. One who is having this Mighty Bow at all times is Dhanvee. It can also remind us of His incarnation as Sree Ramachandraji, when, in order to protect the world from the mighty Raakshasas of Lanka, He had to dedicate a substantial part of His life almost constantly wielding his bow: hence Sri Rama came to be known as Dhanushpaani; in His attitude of protection He is known as Kodandaraama. Thus, the term Dhanvee, the Wielder of the bow, is quite appropriate for Vishnu. \u0027I am Sri Rama among the Wielders of the bow\u0027 –Geeta Ch.l0, St. 31.",
      "\n**Medhaavee**\nSupremely intelligent; One who is capable of understanding everything. One who has the capacity to comprehend intellectually all that is happening around is called Medhaavee. Since Consciousness is the One Light in all living creatures, which illumines all intellects, and since Vishnu is this Infinite Consciousness, He is the One Knower, knowing all things, at all times, at once. Hence Sarasvati, the Goddess of Learning and Knowledge is described as the very tongue of Vishnu.",
      "\n**Vikramah**\nWhile describing the term Vikramee(75) we had already explained the meaning contents of Vikrama, and thus Vikrama is an appellation that had come to Vishnu as a result of His Supernatural Act of measuring the universe with three steps. Also, Vi means the \u0027king-of-birds\u0027, the white-necked eagle; Krama means steps and, therefore, \u0027movement or travel\u0027. In this sense Vikrama can mean: \u0027One who rides on the white- eagle (mind) is Vishnu\u0027-who is described as having Garuda for His vehicle (Vaahanam).",
      "\n**Kramah**\nHe who is All-Pervading is Kramah. Because of His All-Pervasiveness, the Infinite is called as Vishnu. That which goes beyond the frontiers of the known is the Supreme, and, therefore, in the description of Him, who has manifested as the Cosmos, we have in Purushasookta an indication that He not only pervades all that is known but \u0027extends even beyond by ten digits\u0027 (Atyatishthat Dasaangulam).",
      "\n**Anuttamah**\nOne who is \u0027incomparably Great\u0027 in glory-Anuttamah. In the Sanskrit construction of the word, it means something more than what we have said; it means: \u0027He is one, beyond whom there exists none who is greater than He (unexcelled).

To one who has realized the Infinite, the lower nature of the mind (Daityas) and the enchantments of the senses (Raakshasas) , are all helpless to overwhelm Him. \u0027Rasopyasya Param Drishtvaa Nivartate\u0027 -Geeta Ch. 2, St. 59.",

Vishnu is the One who knows clearly the exact depth of sincerity, the true ardency of devotion, the real amount of purity in the bosom of all his devotees, and, accordingly, brings joy and bliss to their hearts.",

Since the Lord is the Ultimate Goal, Saranam, He is also the \u0027Destination\u0027, the \u0027Harbour\u0027. The One Who realizes Him comes to live in Him. He is the home to which the prodigal son (jeeva) ultimately returns.

Rig Veda (1-81-5): \u0027He was neither born nor is He going to be born.\u0027",
      "\n**Sarvesvarah**\nGod of all gods or the Supreme Controller of all. In a sense it means the Almighty, the All-powerful. \u0027He is the Lord of all,\u0027 says Brihad Upanishad (6-4-2).",

      "\n**Vrishaakapih**\nThere is a lot of controversy among pundits upon the exact meaning of this term.

In Sanskrit the term Kapi has a meaning: \u0027that which saves one from drowning\u0027. Lord in the form of the Great Boar, (Varaaha) in that incarnation, had lifted the world from the waters at the end of the deluge; the term vrisha means \u0027Dharma\u0027.

Attachment to a thing is possible only when the object-of-attachment is other than the subject, In the One Infinite Reality there cannot be any attachment with anything, mainly because there is nothing here that is not the Infinite Itself. The Infinite is a Mass of Love; there is no attachment in It; for, attachment is Love with possessiveness and desire for gratification, \u0027This Purusha is, indeed, unattached\u0027, roars Brihad Upanishad (6-3-15), Lastly, the term, Sarva- Yoga- Vinissritah can also mean that He is beyond the reach of the various systems of Yogas taught in the Sastras. These systems are to quieten the mind, to end the misapprehensions-of- Truth, to annihilate the Maayaa, What is there left over in the seeker\u0027s bosom is the Self-the Great Vishnu,\n"

      "**Vasuh**\nThe One who is the very support of all elements, and the One who Himself is the very Essence of the elements, This is something like the dream made up of our own mind; and the very same dream-world plays itself out, all the time sustained in the very same mind. Similarly, the Self indwells all and all dwell in the Self. In the Geeta we are told by the Lord, \u0027I am among the Vasus the Paavakah\u0027-(Geeta. Ch. 10, St. 23). Therefore, the Self exists like air-allowing everything to remain in it and sustaining everything by it.",
      "\n**Vasumanaah**\nOne who has a mind which is Supremely Pure; meaning a mind that has none of the sins of passions and pains; none of the storms of desires and jealousies; none of the quakes of likes and dislikes.",
      "\n**Satyah**\nHe is the Real. The term Satyam used in philosophy has a special connotation. That which remains the same in all the three periods of time is called Satyam. That which seemingly exists, but which never was nor shall ever be, is considered as a false delusion, A-satya. He who remains the same, before the creation, during the existence and even after the dissolution, is the Infinite Truth, Satyah. The Taittireeya Upanishad thunders that the Eternal Truth is \u0027Truth, Knowledge, Bliss\u0027: \u0027Satyam, Jnaanam, Anantam Brahma\u0027 - Taittireeya Upanishad: 2-1. We may here mention a couple of other meanings that are generally given to this term \u0027The best among good people is Satyam. Again, the word Satyam is made up of three sounds -Sat-ti-yam -and, herein, according to the Upanishad itself, \u0027Sat means praana, ti means food, Yam means sun;\u0027 therefore, Sat yam is the Law which orders the food to sustain the praana when both are blessed by the sources of all gross energies in the cosmos, the Sun.",
      "\n**Samaatmaa**\nHe wbo is equally in all. In Kathopanishad we read the declaration of Lord Death to Nachiketas how the same Truth has come to express itself differently from form to form. To visualize the Paramesvara who revels equally ill all, among the perishables and imperishables, is the Vision Divine. Kauseshika Upanishad (3-9) says, \u0027One should understand that the Self is the same-in-all\u0027. In the Geeta also is the declaration \u0027I am the Seer in all the fields-of-experiences everywhere\u0027 -Geeta Ch. 13, St. 3).",
      "\n**Sammitah**\nThe term Sammatam means \u0027acceptable\u0027. The One. Truth, which has been proved and accepted by the Rishis In the Upanishads through subtle logic and philosophical reasoning, is called Sammatah. This is the most direct and very appealing meaning. But there are some who would interpret this portion of the Thousand Names of Lord Vishnu by combining Samaatmaa",
      "\n**Samah**\nEqual; the same. Truth remains the same. One Infinite Reality plays the game of plurality. As has been said in the Kathopanishad, \u0027The One Principle of Fire having entered this world burns itself out differently according to the equipments upon which it is manifested\u0027, so the One Truth manifests as the many Jeevas. Hence He is called the Samah. Also it can mean as One who is ever united, with (Sa) Lakshmi (Maa).",
      "\n**Amoghah**\nMoghah means \u0027useless fellow\u0027 (Nishphalah), \u0027a disappointing power\u0027. Amogha is the opposite of it: \u0027Ever Useful\u0027, \u0027Ever the Fulfiller\u0027 of all the wishes and demands of His devotees. Chandogya Upanishad (8-1-5) declares: \u0027Truthful is His wish, and Truth is His resolve\u0027.",
      "\n**Pundareekaakshah**\nOne who can be contacted and fully experienced in the Heart Space (Pundareekam). In the Narayana Upanishad (10) we find the same term employed: \u0027In the core of the body, in the Heart Space, dwells the Supreme.\u0027 In the \u0027Heart\u0027, the meditator can experience the Reality more readily and very clearly, and so the All- Pervading Reality is described as \u0027dwelling in the Heart-cave\u0027.",
      "\n**Vrishakarmaa**\nVrisha means Dharma. One whose every activity is righteous and who acts only to establish righteousness. \u0027For the sake of establishing Dharma, I am born in every age\u0027, says Lord -(Geeta Ch. 4, St. 8).",
      "\n**Vrishaakritih**\nOne who is of the form (Aakriti) of Dharma (Vrisha). It is not only that His actions are righteous but He is Himself Righteousness. It can also mean as One who takes different forms during His Divine Incarnations-all for maintaining the Rule of Dharma in the world.\n"

      "**Rudrah**\nOne who makes all people weep, At the time of death or during the total dissolution, the One who makes all weep is Rudrah. From a devotee\u0027s standpoint the same term is interpreted as the One who liquidated all sorrows is Rudrah. Bhagavan declares Himself to be \u0027Among the Rudras, I am Sankara –(Geeta Ch. 10, St. 23). According to the Vedic terminology there are 11 Rudras; this eleventh \u0027Rudra\u0027 is called as Sankara: Sam-karoti-iti \u003d Sankarah - \u0027One who blesses all with Auspiciousness (Sam).\u0027",
      "\n**Bahusiraah**\nOne who has many heads. The Purushasooktam of the Rig Veda describes the Cosmic Form of the Lord with a narration, \u0027The Purusha of thousand heads, thousand eyes and thousand feet…….\u0027 In Geeta a similar description of the Universal Form of the Lord is found in Chapter XI. Again in the Geeta Chapter XIII when the Lord was describing the Infinite Goal to be known (Jneyam), He describes It as \u0027Everywhere legs, everywhere hands, every- where eyes, everywhere His face\u0027. Thus, He whose personal manifestations constitute the universe is known as \u0027One who has many heads.\u0027",
      "\n**Babhruh**\nOne who rules over the worlds. \u0027Like a King\u0027 -Atmabodham gives this analogy .He in whose presence all the instruments of perception, feeling and knowing continue their coordinated activity is the Self, the Atman, who is Great Lord Vishnu.",
      "\n**Visvayonih**\nOne who is the Total Cause from which alone the entire world of experiences (visvam) has emerged out. The womb (yoni) from which thoughts and actions had risen is called Visvayonih.",
      "\n**Suchisravaah**\nOne who has beautiful and efficient ears (Sravas): \u0027Everywhere are His ears\u0027-(Geeta Ch. 13, St. 13) meaning thereby He is the Hearer in all ears. The term Sravas not only means ears, but it also means \u0027names\u0027 -so Suchisravas can mean \u0027One who has Divine and Sacred names\u0027. Thus, the devotee can invoke Him with thousands of His names when He can readily listen in and rightly understand the exact purity and the real depth of devotion in the devotee. Also the term can be used to indicate the One whose \u0027names\u0027 are worthy of being heard by seekers.",
      "\n**Amritah**\nOne who is Immortal and Immutable. Mritam \u003d dead. The Infinite is Ajarah, Amarah and Avyayah. It can also mean as One who is of the nature of Nectar (Amritam) -a sure cure for those who are suffering from malady of ignorance. Amritah also means Moksha; and thus it is indicated, He is the ever-liberated-the Pure State of Being.",
      "\n**Saasvata-sthaanuh**\nOne who is both permanent (Saasvatah) and irremovable (Sthaanuh). He is the One who remains Changeless, because Immortal; who remains the same in all periods of time, because permanent (Saasvatah); and who remains changeless in His nature or Consciousness (Sthaanuh). This is a single term (Saasvata-sthaanuh) and, therefore, we must add the meanings together- Permanent and Changeless; Permanently Changeless Factor in lire is Vishnu.",
      "\n**Vararohah**\nHe who is the most Glorious (Vara) Destination (Aaroha). The Seat of the Self is the most Glorious because the imperfections of the world-of-matter (Prakriti) are not there in the Spirit (Purusha). Liberation from the thraldom of matter is the arrival of the Infinitude of the Self. \u0027He never returns\u0027, thunders the Chandogya Upanishad (8-15-1) three times in one and the same breath, assuring us that one who has reached the Seat of Vishnu, beyond the frontiers of the intellect, there is for him no more any return ever into the ego-centric life of tensions of sorrows.",
      "\n**Mahaatapaah**\nOne of great Tapas. The term tapas in Sanskrit has three meanings: \u0027Knowledge\u0027 (Jnaana), \u0027Prosperity\u0027 (Aisvarya) and also \u0027Might\u0027 (Prataapa). It is in the presence of Consciousness that we come to know all our experiences. \u0027Conscious of\u0027 a thing or an idea is the \u0027Knowledge of\u0027 the thing or the idea. That about which I am not conscious of, I have really no knowledge of it. All knowledges, of all bosoms, in all living creatures, everywhere, at all times, cannot be without the play of Consciousness upon the respective objects of knowledge, and hence this Consciousness is indicated in the Upanishads as Pure Knowledge, in the light of which alone all knowledges are possible. All achievements and prosperity (Aisvarya), all might and power of the living creatures can express themselves through them only when they are alive. This great truth is Maha Vishnu. \u0027Whose Tapas is of the nature of Knowledge\u0027 (Mundaka- Upanishad. 1-1-9).\n"

The cause pervades its effect: gold in all ornaments; ocean in all waves; cotton in all cloth. The Infinite Consciousness Itself expresses as both world-of-matter (Kshetra) and the Knower-of-the-field (Kshetrajna). Vishnu, the Infinite is beyond these two (Uttamah Purushah) in whom there is no expression of matter and, there- fore, no \u0027Knower\u0027-hood. He is the All-Pervading Self, Maha Vishnu.",

In the Mundaka Upanishad (4.10) also we read: \u0027By its Light alone it illumines all other experiences.\u0027 Sarvavit-Bhaanuh is one term: meaning that all Knowing Effulgent Consciousness.",

      "\n**Janaardanah**\nThe term Ardayati is a verb meaning both \u0027giving sorrow\u0027 or \u0027giving joy\u0027. Thus, One who gives sorrow and disaster to the vicious, and who blesses with joy and peace to the good people is called Janaardanah.",
      "\n**Vedah**\n–The term Veda comes from the root vid: \u0027to know\u0027. Since Veda gives knowledge, the Lord is termed as Vedah, in the sense, that He is the One who gives the Knowledge of the Reality, because He is the very Reality. In Mahabharata, Vyasa says: \u0027Krishna alone is All-vedas, All-sciences, All-techniques and All-dedicated Actions\u0027. In the Bhagavad Geeta (Ch. 10, St.2) Lord says: \u0027Out of mere compassion for them, I, abiding in their Self, destroy the darkness born of ignorance, by the luminous lamp of wisdom\u0027.",
      "\n**Vedavit**\n–\u0027One who knows the veda\u0027. The Lord alone is the One Experience without which the Vedas cannot be fully realized. The surest and the most exhaustive commentary of the Vedas is to be found only in a stilled mind, which is in communion with Vishnu, the Supreme Reality. Geeta (Ch. 15, St. 15) says, \u0027I am the author of the Vedanta, as well as the Knower of the Vedas.\u0027",
      "\n**Avyangah**\nHe who has no imperfections (Vyanga) anywhere in him- The All-Perfect. The term Vyanga also means person, and so A vyanga means One who cannot be known by anyone in any \u0027personal-form\u0027. Geeta plainly says \u0027This great Reality is Imperceptible, Unthinkable, without any modifications\u0027. -Geeta. Ch. 2, St. 25",
      "\n**Vedaangah**\nOne whose very limbs are the vedas. In Kenopanishad in the closing stanzas, the teacher insists that all knowledges are Its limbs.",
      "\n**Vedavit**\n\u0027One who contemplates upon the Veda is Vedavit\u0027: (Vedam Vichaarayati\u003dVedavit). Mere word meaning cannot give us the true concept of the subtle theme discussed in the Vedas. Continuous reflection upon their declarations alone can reach us to the peaks of their imports. In the Geeta, Bhagavan Himself declares that He is not only the very Revealer of Vedas but He is at once the Knower of the Veda -Geeta Ch. 15, St. 15. It is absolutely necessary that the student of the Vedas should try to understand the meaning of their declaration. To repeat the mantras parrot-like is not of any consequence: \u0027He who has studied the Vedas but has not understood the meaning, but carries a load, as the \u0027road-rest\u0027 on the roadside.\u0027 Thus He who constantly reflects upon the Veda, and naturally lives up to it, is the Great Lord.",

      "**Lokaadhyakshah**\nOne who presides over all fields of experiences -all lokas. President is one who is responsible for the conduct of the assembly; he guides the discussion in a disciplined manner, and ultimately at the end of it all, he dissolves the meeting. All through the discussions he never interferes with the freedom of speech and action of the members, if they act within the agenda of the day. Similarly, the Lord presides over all the fields of activities, never interfering with the freedom of the individuals to act. \u0027The Supreme Purusha in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord, and the Supreme Self.\u0027 From the Puranic standpoint the Lord in His Vaamana manifestation was installed as the king of the three worlds and, therefore, this name, say the Pauraanikas.",
      "\n**Suraadhyakshah**\nThe President of the Heavens to whom the Devas run for protection when they are threatened by their constant enemies -the Daityas and the Asuras. When in the Heaven of our bosom, the thought-angels are threatened by the negative tendencies and criminal purposes, He to whom the good in us surrender totally for sure protection and safety is Vishnu, the President within the bosom.",
      "\n**Dharmaadhyakshah**\nPresiding over the activities of the living organisms, Consciousness revels, illumining both the good and the evil therein. The One Sacred factor that constantly thus illumines all the nature and functions (Dharma) of the body, mind and intellect is the Dharmaa- dhyakshah, Lord Vishnu.",
      "\n**Kritaakritah**\nKritam \u003d that which is done \u003d that which is manifested or created Akritam, therefore, is that which has not manifested or become. The former (Kritam) indicates all the \u0027effects\u0027 manifested out of the Creator\u0027s activities, and the latter (Akritam) is the \u0027cause\u0027 from which no manifestation has yet emerged -it is still unmanifest. The Self, the Atman, is the \u0027Post\u0027 -in the ghost-in-the-post example -upon which the cause and the effect, the unmanifest and the manifest, like the \u0027ghost\u0027 apparently come to play (Kritam \u003d Vyaktam, A-Kritam \u003d A-Vyaktam).",
      "\n**Chaturaatmaa**\nThe Self is described as four-fold when we consider the Atman as the Glory (Vibhooti) of the Self. Thus, the Essential factors, with which alone the endless play of creation, sustenance and destruction can continue, are the glories of the Self (Aatma-Vibhooti). In Vishnu Purana, four distinct vibhooties of the Lord -when He functions as the creator, sustainer and destroyer -are found enumerated. From the standpoint of a Vedantic student, since in the Non-dual Reality there cannot be anything other than It- self, all the plays of the gross, the subtle and causal bodies, in the microcosm and in the macrocosm, are the glories (vibhooties) of the One Self. In the Absolute, in the Eternal, all these are transcended; these- the water, dreamer, deep-sleeper, the Tureeya -are all Its Glories. The Possessor of these Glories is the One that transcends even \u0027Tureeya\u0027; He is called as the Tureeyaateetah.",
      "\n**Chaturvyoohah**\nOne who manifests into the four mighty powers (Vyooha). The Truth, that plays thus Himself in these four levels having apparently created the world of experiences, is Vishnu, the All-Pervading. According to the Vaishnava literature, for the purpose of creation, Maha Vishnu Himself became four mighty powers (Vyooha) and they were called Vaasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. One who has Himself these four mighty powers, necessary for the conduct of plurality, is the Great Self, Maha Vishnu.",
      "\n**Chatur-Damshtrah**\nThe canine teeth fully developed in the upper and the lower rows, as in the case of carnivorous animals, are called in Sanskrit as Damshtraa. This is reminiscent of the Powerful Damshtraa of the Lord when He took the form of Nara-Simha to protect Prahlaada. Also in the Puranas we find that the Great white Elephant of Indra, \u0027 Airaavata,\u0027 has four tusks -He whose glory is the four-tusked Airaavata is Maha- Vishnu. To the student of the Upanishad, it is indeed very clear that these four \u0027tusks\u0027 or \u0027teeth\u0027 are nothing other than the four paadas which Mandukya thunders -\u0027Chatushpaada\u0027. The manifestation of the Might and Glory of the Supreme are the play of the waking, dream and deep-sleep conditions. With reference to these three, transcending them all, is the fourth plane-of-consciousness the Springboard for all these three. He, whose Glory are all these four grinding, crushing, fearful experiences of duality, is the One Non-dual Self, the Great Maha Vishnu.",
      "\n**Chaturbhujah**\n\u0027One who has four hands\u0027. It is famous that Maha Vishnu has four hands and they carry the Conch, the Discus, the Mace, and the Lotus. According to the Puranas, these four are used by the Lord in maintaining Dharma among mankind. The \u0027Conch\u0027 calls man to the righteous path that directly leads to Peace and Perfection, the Divine Vishnupada. Very many of us in the enchantment of the immediate sense-joys refuse to listen to the small inner voice of conscience, the sound of the Paanchajanya-conch, and so He wields the \u0027Mace\u0027 and we come to suffer small calamities and tragic jerks in our smooth existence -communal, social or national. If still the individual is not listening to the call of the \u0027Conch\u0027, the wheel-of-time, Chakra annihilates the entire. The call and the punishment are all only to take man towards his Ultimate Goal, represented by the \u0027Lotus\u0027 in His hand. Subjectively Vishnu is the Self within, who manifests as the four-armed \u0027subtle-body\u0027 to serve as the Eesa of the gross physical structure, in all its actions and protect it with existence. The \u0027Subtle-body\u0027 as the inner-equipment (Antah-Karana) functions as four mighty powers -mind, intellect, chit and ego. Chit is the \u0027Lotus\u0027, intellect is the \u0027Conch\u0027, ego is the \u0027Mace\u0027, and mind is the \u0027Discus\u0027. All these four are wielded by the One Infinite Blue-bodied Narayana, clothed in His \u0027yellow garb\u0027, manifesting to maintain and sustain the world of good and evil. Since the Self functions thus in a four-fold pattern, Vishnu has the appellation, \u0027the four-armed Lord.\u0027\n"

      "**Bhraajishnuh**\nSelf-Effulgent Consciousness illumines everything; and it is not borrowing Its Light from any other source. \u0027It is the Light of lights that illumines even darkness\u0027-(Geeta Ch. 13, St.18). And the Upanishad is equally vehement and declares: \u0027There the sun has no light nor the stars nor these lightnings; how little then can this fire! By its Light alone all these are illumined.",
      "\n**Bhojanam**\nThe immediate meaning of the term is food, viz. eatables. In philosophy it has a wider implication and the term \u0027food\u0027 cannotes the entire field-of-objects experienced or enjoyed by the sense-organs. The world-of-objects projected by the sense-organs, the inner psychological play and this world-of-matter constituting the field-of-plurality, all together is comprehended by the term Maayaa. Thus cathodox commentators reduce this term \u0027Bhojanam\u0027 to the contents and functions of Maayaa. Taittireeya Upanishad (2-7) says: \u0027He is indeed the Essence (Rasa)\u0027.",
      "\n**Bhoktaa**\nThe \u0027Experiencer\u0027 Not only the world-of-objects is essentially nothing but the Spirit, Lord Vishnu, but even the very instruments-of -experiences and their ultimate joys and sorrows, are all illumined for us by the Lord- of-Lakshmi. The Pure Self, expressing through the gross, the subtle and the causal bodies, becomes the waker, dreamer and deep-sleeper, experiencing all happenings, good and bad, as the individuality in that living person. Consciousness, Purusha, identifying with and functioning through matter (Prakriti), comes to experience the endless modifications that are born out of Prakriti. The Self in Its Infinite nature is actionless and yet in Maayaa seems to function and becomes the Enjoyer or Sufferer of the actions of matter.",
      "\n**Sahishnuh**\nOne who is capable of patiently suffering, in his perfect detachment, all that is happening around, is a sahishnuh. Whatever happens to the reflections of the Sun, the Sun in the cosmos is unaffected by them, and with reference to his reflections we can call him a Sahishnuh, the Sun is a mere \u0027witness\u0027 of his own endless reflections. The term has also got two more meanings in Sanskrit as \u0027Forgiver\u0027 or \u0027Conqueror\u0027. Vishnu is one who forgives us readily all our trespasses, and conquers for us all the inimical forces in our inner personality.",
      "\n**Jagadaadijah**\nOne who had born (Jah) in the very beginning (aadi) of the world (jagat) is called Jagadaadijah. At the time of dissolution (Pralaya) when the entire gross and subtle bodies go to lie absorbed in the Total Causal-body, the world, in Pralaya, lies merged in Eesvara. Before the gross world-of-plurality emerges out there should be a condition of subtle manifestation of it in the form of thoughts. Thoughts constitute the mind-intellect; when the Infinite functions through this Total Mind-intellect, It is called as Hiranyagarba the womb of all objects, it is from the Hiranya garba-state, the manifestation of the gross world emerges out, when the lord comes to play as a Virat Aatmaa. Maha Vishnu is the one who was born before the world of gross bodies, therefore it is indicated here that he is the \u0027Womb-of all- objects\u0027 in the world, the Hiranyagarba-the very creator.",
      "\n**Anaghah**\nAgham means sin (Paapa), impurities (mala); and therefore, Anaghah means One who has no imperfections and who is not affected by the good and bad Vaasanaas left over in the personality as a result of the wilful actions. He is the Uncontaminated (Aliptah) .The Light of Consciousness is the Illuminator of the mind, and so the peace of virtue or the agitations of the sin cannot affect the Illuminator -the Illuminator being always different from the illuminated. Chandogya Upanishad (8-1-5) says: \u0027He is free from Sin\u0027.",
      "\n**Vijayah**\n\u0027The Victorious\u0027. One who realizes the Self can thereafter stand apart from the thraldom of matter, Victorious over the tyrannies of the flesh, feelings or facts. Thus, the Seat of Self is the Seat of Victory over matter. The Peace and harmony of the Self can never be assailed by the noisy hordes of the world of plurality. Vijaya is the name also of Arjuna and the Lord Himself says, \u0027Among the Pandavas, I am Arjuna\u0027 - Geeta Ch. 10, St. 37.",
      "\n**Jetaa**\n\u0027Ever Successful\u0027. In all undertakings He alone wins; One who never knows any defeat or failure. Upanishad says: \u0027Truth alone wins, never falsehood\u0027.",
      "\n**Visvayonih**\nIt can be interpreted in two ways as (a) He who is the Cause of the universe or (b) He who has the world as His Cause. The former is clear to those who have so far followed the commentary, and to them the latter may be a very confusing statement. From the standpoint of the Puranas, it is logical. The Self has manifested as the various Incarnations from time to time because of the condition of the world, and therefore, Visvam is the cause for His manifestations.",

    "englishExplanation": [
      "**Upendrah**\nThe younger brother of Indra. In His Incarnation as Vaamana, He was born to Aditi, who was the mother of Indra, and hence, the Lord is known as the \u0027Younger brother of Indra\u0027. In Sanskrit the prefix upa denotes \u0027Above\u0027 in the sense of \u0027superior to\u0027; therefore, Upendra may also mean \u0027One who is superior to Indra\u0027, the king of gods. Such an explanation we find in the Harivamsa (76-47). Indra, the king of the sense-organs, is the mind and the Consciousness, which is the Self, is the One factor that dynamises the mind. Since life is that which controls even the mind, certainly It is superior to the mind and this Self is the Maha Vishnu.",
      "\n**Vaamanah**\nOf the ten great incarnations, the fifth one is Vaamana; and the very name indicates \u0027One who has a small body\u0027. It was in the form of a child (vatuh \u003dA child student in a gurukula) that Vaamana approached the divinely righteous Emperor Mahaabali to beg of him a little land, of the length of his tiny three steps-and the Lord measured in His three steps all the three worlds and thus conquered Mahaabali. He checked (Vamayati) the rising pride of possession in Bali, hence He, in that incarnation as a Vatu, is called Vaamana. The term Vaamana also means \u0027worshipful\u0027: \u0027Him, the Dwarf, sitting in the middle of the heart, all gods adore\u0027, so we read in the Kathopanishad (5-3). However, here the emphasis should be upon the meaning \u0027short statured\u0027 because of the contrast it makes with the following name.",
      "\n**Praamsuh**\nOne whose body is vast is called Praamsuh. Vaamana, when He got the promise from the righteous King, and when He started measuring, the Lord took His Cosmic Form, and with each step measured the earth, the interspace, and the heaven. In Harivamsa (262-263) there is a beautiful description of the little Vaamana growing into His Total Form. The rate of His expansion is described with reference to two fixed factors the Sun and the Moon. When He took the form, the Sun and the Moon were His eyes; as He measured the earth, they came to His bosom; as He was measuring the space, the Sun was at His navel and as He lifted His feet to measure the Heaven, the Sun and the Moon were just below His knees.",
      "\n**Amoghah**\nOne whose activities are ever a fulfilment of some great purpose. Even insignificant actions, which, ordinarily, people would think are empty and purposeless, are never really so, when they spring from Him. Even when He punishes, it is only for inaugurating a greater evolutionary blessing.",
      "\n**Suchih**\nOne who is spotlessly \u0027clean\u0027, and therefore, Ever-Pure. Impurities in a substance are things other than itself; when dust is on the cloth, the cloth is impure, unclean. Since the Self, the Aatman, is the Non- Dual Reality, having nothing other than Itself in It, Ever-pure alone must It always be. And Suchih is One who gives this purity to those who contemplate upon Him constantly.",
      "\n**Oorjitah**\nOne who has infinite strength and vitality. Wherever, in the organism, we meet with any strength and vitality they are all the strength and vitality of the Self. The Infinite Vishnu is the One All-Pervading Self, and therefore, He is the very springhead for all strength.",
      "\n**Ateendrah**\nOne who is beyond Indra in knowledge, glory and strength. Since Indra represents the \u0027mind-intellect\u0027 equipment, Aatman, the Self is denoted here as that which transcends the mind.",
      "\n**Samgrahah**\nOne who holds the entire world of beings-and-things together in an indissoluble embrace unto Himself. Just as the hub of a wheel holds the rim unto itself by its endless spokes, so too the Aatman, the Self within, lends Its vitality to every cell in the body and to every thought in the inner-equipments. In none can anything happen which is not a glory borrowed from Him. And, the Self, being the same everywhere, in all existence, in both the movables and immovables, gross and subtle -in the manifest as well as in the unmanifest - He certainly is the One who holds the world of phenomena unto Himself in a vast embrace of Love and Oneness.",
      "\n**Sargah**\nOne who has created out of Him- self the whole world. It therefore must also connote One, who has the whole created world as His own form, since the creation is His own manifestation as the Subtle and the Gross.",
      "\n**Dhritaatmaa**\nOne who supports Himself by Himself. In the previous epithet Samgrahah, He was shown as the Cohesion of Love in the world of matter and energy, and in Sargah, He, as the One material and efficient cause of creation, was shown as also the very supporter of the manifested world. But who supports Him? He is Dhritaatmaa - He is established in Himself.",
      "\n**Niyamah**\nThe Appointing Authority: It is He, who orders all the mighty forces of nature and prescribes for each the Laws of their conduct, the ways of their behaviour and the methods of their functions. The Sun, Moon, Air, Waters, Dik-Paalakas, Death etc. are all appointed and ordered by the Lord.",
      "\n**Yamah**\nOne who is the mighty Power that administers all the forces of Nature under His Law. Everything in nature strictly obeys ever all His Laws.\n"

That final knowledge, knowing which every-thing becomes known. \u0027Kasmin nu bhagavo vijnaate sarvamidam vijnaatam bhavati iti\u0027-(Mundaka. 1-3). All sciences are investigations into Truth After observing the nature and behaviour of things and beings when the investigator moves ahead seeking the ONE Harmonious Chord of Reality that holds all phenomena in its inescapable love-web, the scientist of Truth-comes to reject first the gross, and soon thereafter the subtle realms, and ultimately even the causal factors, and thus-comes to apprehend this harmony, which he is seeking as the very subjective core of his own Self. This final Goal to be realized, \u0027having known which everything else becomes known,\u0027 the One Consummate Knowledge to be gained (Vedyah), is the Self, the Great Vishnu.",
      "\n**Vaidyah**\nThe One Supreme Doctor who alone can minister to the world suffering from ego and egocentric misconceptions. One who is a master of all knowledge (Vidyaa) is also termed as Vaidvah",
      "\n**Sadaa Yogee**\nTo the confused and the deluded to detach themselves from the false vestures-of-matter and to seek their identity with the ETERNAL Self is called Yoga. All attempts in attaining an at-one-ment with the Self is called Yoga. The Goal, the Self, therefore, in the language of the seeker must be Sadaayoga-ever-in yoga.",
      "\n**Veerahaa**\n\u0027He who destroys the mighty heroes\u0027. The powerful men of strength and valour when they grow in their audacity to become tyrants, the Lord manifests to destroy such Raakshasas and thus protects the Dharma and the Good.",
      "\n**Maadhavah**\nEarlier this term was used (72) where we interpreted the term as the \u0027Lord of Lakshmi.\u0027 Maa means not only \u0027Lakshmi,\u0027 but she is also \u0027Vidyaa\u0027 (Knowledge). The Lord (Dhava) of all Knowledge (Maa) is Maadhava. He who helps introspection and meditation in the seeker is Maadhava. \u0027To become conscious of the existence of a thing\u0027 is called the knowledge of the thing, The Aatman, the Self is Existence (Sat) and Consciousness (Sphurana) and, therefore, Lord Vishnu, the Self is the source of all knowledge and as such the Master of all Vidyaas: (Maa-dhava), Harivamsa says\u0027 \u0027O Hari, You are the Lord (Dhava) of Knowledge (Maa), and hence You are called as Maadhava, the Master of Maa.\u0027",
      "\n**Madhuh**\nThe term Madhuh familiarly stands for \u0027honey\u0027. It is also a term to indicate \u0027nectar.\u0027 One who generates Nectarine Bliss in the hearts of His devotees is called Madhuh. The springtime in India is called as Madhumaasa since spring is the season of flowers; full of honey for the bees, and joy for man. The month called Madhu (March- April) is the Chaitra month which is considered specially auspicious for prayers, and meditation. One who is of the nature of the Maadhava-maasa, the month of Maadhava (April-May) can also be the suggestion in this term. Vaisaakha (April-May) is considered as the most auspicious time of the year for the worship of Vishnu by all Vaishnavites.",

Lending to them, all their very vitality, is His mere presence! He is the very \u0027subject\u0027 in the perceiver, and, therefore, the instruments of perceptions, emotions, and thoughts cannot experience Him: this Source of All-life is Maha Vishnu. Kathopanishad (3-15) says: \u0027He is soundless, untouched, formless, immutable, so without taste, eternal, smell-less.",
      "\n**Mahaamaayah**\nOne who is the Supreme Master of all Maayaa. He is the very Substratum upon which all the plurality spring up and play their infinite enchantments, constantly basking in the Light of the Supreme Consciousness. Aatman, the Self, is untouched by the play of Maayaa, and yet the Maayaa-play is sustained only by the exuberant warmth of His Divine presence. The Sun is the Master of all clouds, inasmuch as, in its presence, borrowing its heat, water by its own nature gets evaporated, and the water, vapour again, because of its own nature of a lesser density than the atmospheric air, rises to the higher altitudes and gathers there as clouds. It is, again, the nature of the atmosphere that at higher altitudes it is cooler and the water-vapour so cooled becomes water again, and due to the higher density of water it descends as rain. In this example the Sun can be called as the \u0027Creator\u0027 of all clouds and the \u0027Cause for the rams,\u0027 and consequently the sun is also the \u0027 Master of the Seasons.\u0027 And yet, the Sun is uncontaminated by all these phenomena that are happening in its presence. In the same fashion the Infinite Reality, Vishnu, is indicated here as the Great Magician, who has the magic of Maayaa at His command. Krishna Himself confesses in the Geeta: \u0027Very difficult indeed it is to cross over My Maayaa\u0027 -(Geeta Ch. 7 St. 14).",
      "\n**Mahotsaahah**\nThe Great Enthusiast; the Ever-Dynamic Accomplisher. The Powers of creation, of sustenance and of annihilation-in their totality is the world of birth and death that we live in. This wonderful world cannot be sustained without the endless enthusiasm of this Mighty Power. Looking at the ocean, through the waves, we come to recognise the ocean as the \u0027Sleepless Agitator\u0027; similarly, looking at Vishnu, \u0027through the ephimeral kaleidoscopic changes in the patterns of life available to us in our experience today, we call Him as the \u0027Dynamic accomplisher\u0027 (Mahotsaahah). The term employed here, the Enthusiastic Accomplisher, is indeed one of the most appropriate names for Maha Vishnu.",
      "\n**Mahaabalah**\nOne who has Supreme Strength. He, being Omnipotent, is the Source of all Strength that we see in each individual organism in life. His Vitality reflected in each of us, is our individual strength; naturally He is the Infinitely Strong, Mahaabalah.\n"

The intelligence in a mathematician, poet or an artist, scientist or politician-all are the different play-patterns of energies invoked from the one Supreme Intelligence, and therefore, Mahavishnu, the Self, is called here as Mahaabuddhih, the Reservoir of all Intelligence.",

Since the Divine is the very source, from which alone the dynamism for creation can manifest, the Supreme Divinity is termed here as the Mahaaveerya. (175) Mahaasaktih -All-Powerful.

The Pure Consciousness is the illuminator of all, including all other material sources of light in the world-Sun, Moon, stars, fire etc.-but this is not all; He is also the One, who is Himself Self-Effulgent. This is Mahavishnu-the Supreme Self. In the Mundakopanishad (4-9) Lord is described as the \u0027Light of lights\u0027. Brihadaaranya- kopanishad (6-3-9) declares: \u0027He is Self-effulgent\u0027.",

Vishnu is that Truth which is the Subjective Essence in all of us; He is that \u0027Knowledge\u0027, in the light of which, all other knowledges are rendered possible.

As Aatman (Kshetrajna) He, the One, expresses Himself everywhere in every equipment (Kshetra), as the \u0027knower\u0027 in each \u0027field\u0027. Since these equipments are infinite in number, as the individuality (jeeva) in each one of the created beings, His own Glory expresses in endless manifestations.",
      "\n**Mahaadridhrik**\nOne who supports the great Mountain. In the Puranas, we find two instances, wherein the Lord has been described as the uplifter of or as having lifted and supported the mountains. While churning the milky ocean with the Mandara mountain we are told that the \u0027churning-stick\u0027 sunk into the bottom and the Lord had to manifest in the form of the Great Tortoise (Koorma) and support it, while the Gods and Demons continued the churning, until they gathered the nectar (Amritam). Again, the Supreme, as Lord Krishna, in order to protect the cows had to lift the Govardhana Mountain. Because of these two stories in the Puranas, Lord, the Protector of the mind in Saadhanaa, is called as Mahaadridhrik. Vishnu is the Divine, that supports the mind-intellect of the Saadhaka while he is churning, through study (sravana) and reflection (manana), his own Milk-like pure heart-of devotion in order to gain the experience of Immortality (Amritam).\n"

Thus I, the Jeeva (Aham), once detached from the conditionings, IS essentially nothing other than He, the Lord (Sah). This experience that Aham is Sah is the very God-consciousness and therefore, Vishnu, the Supreme State of Realization is declared as Hamsah.",

Thus traditionally in the Upanishads, the Suparnas suggest the Jeevaatmaa and the Paramaatmaa sitting on the same tree (body): one (Jeeva) eats the fruits (of actions) and the other (the Self) merely gazes on (Saakshee).

And in the Non-dual Supreme, there cannot be any object other than itself. Therefore, that \u0027State\u0027 is called as the Total Destroyer. The State of Waking is the \u0027destroyer\u0027 of the dream-world; the State of Sleep is the \u0027destroyer\u0027 of the waking and the dream; the State of God Consciousness is the total \u0027 Annihilator\u0027 of all the known three planes of Consciousness. He is Simhah -a word that has been formed by the mutual transposition of the letters in Himsaa. Even taking its obvious superficial meaning Vishnu is a Lion in our bosom, in as much as, He is the king of the forest of Samsaar: at the roar of Narayana all the animal-passions flee from the jungles of the mind.

Hence He is called as the One who is apparently conditioned by the actions that emanate from Him, Sandhimaan, enjoyer (conditioned). In fact, He is the One presiding over and illumining all actions; the very Law of reaction Itself; the ensuing experience in all actions of all people, at all times.

Svetaasvatara Upanishad (6-18) says, \u0027He who first Created the Creator (Brahmaa) and imparted him the Vedas.\u0027 The Guru and the scripture, devotion to God, meditation, moral conduct and the religious discipline are all necessary, in as much as, they prepare the bosom of the seeker for the dawn of realization. But the final unveiling is done by the Infinite alone, and hence, Vishnu, the Self, is the best among the Gurus. Heaviness is called by the same term (Gurutvam), and in this sense the Lord is Indicated here as \u0027that which is heavier than the heaviest.",
      "\n**Dhaama**\nThe Goal; the Sacred destination of a pilgrimage. The Supreme is the Param-dhaama, the \u0027Supreme Destination\u0027, having reached which, there is nothing more to reach beyond. This Absolute State of Perfection is called the \u0027Peak\u0027 (Dhaama). The Sanskrit term Dhaama also means \u0027Effulgence\u0027 (Tejas); the Pure Consciousness as the illuminator of all experiences is considered and glorified as the Light of all Lights etc.",
      "\n**Satyah**\nOne who is Himself the Truth. The difference from the general connotation, we have for the term \u0027That which remains without a change in the past, present and future\u0027 is called Sat yam. \u0027Truth, Knowledge, Infinite is Brahman\u0027, thunder the scriptures. Brihad Upanishad (4-1-20) says, \u0027The Praanas are the truth, and He is the Truth of them.\u0027",
      "\n**Satyaparaakramah**\nDynamic Truth. Passive truthfulness is the harbour of the fools, the dark den of the cowards; although it is any day better than suicidal un- truth and criminal dishonesty. The Lord, the Infinite is not only Himself the Truth but He is Dynamic in insisting that \u0027Truth shall prevail, not untruth\u0027. Not only gravity is a law of nature, itself ever truthful, but it insists that none shall escape its influence or disobey sway. So too, the Infinite Law of Harmony and Love is an Inevitable Truth persisting with insistence in life. The Lord is therefore indicated by the term \u0027 Satyaparaakramah\u0027.",
      "\n**Nimishah**\nThe condition of \u0027the eyelids closed\u0027 is called Nimishah; the unwinking is called Animishah. When the eyes are open, the mind is extrovert; the condition of mental introvertedness is expressed in an unconscious closing of the eyes. When a man is deeply thinking, remembering, contemplating, we find him naturally closing his eyes. In a state of intense contemplation, when the intellect is turned away from the objects-of-experiences, the bosom experiences the One Divine \u0027Subject\u0027 both within and without. The Lord is described here as \u0027with eyes closed\u0027, only to indicate that He is ever rooted in Himself; from Him viewed, there exists nothing other than Himself to constitute the world- of-objects.",
      "\n**Animishah**\nOne who remains unwinking. Whenever we wink both the eyelids close together and what we are seeing is at least technically veiled from the seer in the eye. The Supreme is indicated here by the term \u0027unwinking\u0027, in the sense that, the consciousness is Ever-Knowing. In Sankara\u0027s words, in Chandogya Bhaashya, \u0027there is no cession of knowing in the knower\u0027.",
      "\n**Sragvee**\nA garland is called Srak and, therefore, the term means One who is constantly wearing a garland of undecaying flowers. The famous garland of Vishnu is called Vaijayantee.",
      "\n**Vaachaspatir**\nUdaaradheeh -Vaachaspati is a term given to One who is eloquent in cham\u0027 pioning the Supreme law of life; and Dheeh means the power of intelligence; and Udaaradheeh one who has a \u0027Large- hearted intelligence\u0027, One who is not puritanical in his view points. God is not only the Declarer of the Law but He has a large-hearted tolerance to appreciate the weakness of the devotee\u0027s heart, suffering under the delusion of Maayaa, and hence, has a great sympathy for the weakness in us This is expressed in God\u0027s Infinite kindness towards sinners in general. The laws of spiritual living can be disobeyed for a long time without any tyrannical onslaught, unlike the law of physical nature, which is blind and uncompromising. Fire knows no mercy. But Narayana, the Great Vishnu, is kind and considerate the while He expresses the Truth of Life eloquently at all times around us. In His Large-heartedness, He has enough paternal kindness to overlook our trespasses.\n"

The repetition (Aavartanam) of these changes is the experience of Samsaar, and the One mighty Lord, in whose presence alone the factors of matter start their thrilled dance of decay, is indicated here (Aavartanah) as \u0027the Great Power behind the continuity of change in the world of phenomena\u0027. In the Geeta, Bhagavan says, \u0027O Arjuna, the Lord dwells in the heart of all, and spins, through His Maayaa, all layers of personal ties as though the universe is a complicated machinery.\u0027",

This intellectual state of non-apprehension (Aavarana) creates the agitation (Vikshepa) which is the cause for the misapprehensions of Truth as the sad and sorrowful world of imperfections. Thus veiled, lies the Truth today to the seeker, and that Glorious spiritual Centre is Vishnu.",
      "\n**Sampramardanah**\nOne who persecutes relentlessly men, who are sensuous, evil-minded, and so, fully extrovert in their personality (Raakshasas). In the form of disease, decay, disaster or death That which manifests to annihilate the pride, vanity and conceits of all \u0027animal-men\u0027, as they live drowned in their flesh cravings, low emotions and materialistic values, is the Ultimate Reality-the Supreme Lord Vishnu.",

The one who dynamises the day and lends the enchantment of joy to all living creatures is the Sun. The Mighty Truth, who, in the form of the Sun, gives life to all and lends this energy to them to act, is Vishnu.

Even to those who can remember Him, even if it be in a spirit of constant and faithful antagonism, His Grace is readily available. In Bhaagavata we read Pootanaa, who tried to poison Him, Kamsa, who planned to murder Him, or Sisupaala, who falsely accused Him-all of them were ultimately rewarded by the Lord. In the Geeta, He confesses, \u0027with a little am I satisfied, if it is given with sincerity, and with faithful consistency\u0027.",
      "\n**Prasannaatmaa**\nEver-Pure and All- Blissful Self. The Supreme is ever-pure because, It is untouched by the sorrows lived by matter, when matter is ruled over by its gunas. In Geeta we read that the cause for all the sorrows of the individuality (Jeeva) is the attachment with matter and its various imperfect conditions (Gunas). Since He is untouched by them He is Ever-Pure; and since no identification of matter is in Him, He is all-Bliss.",

      "\n**Visvabhuk**\nThe One who enjoys or swallows (Bhuk) all experiences (Visva). The Supreme Consciousness apparently conditioned by the mind and intellect is the experiencer of the joys and sorrows. The term also means, \u0027the One who absorbs unto Himself all names and forms\u0027 at the time of the dissolution (Pralaya) .In the plane of God-consciousness all other experiences, gathered in fields of waking, dream and deep- sleep, are transcended and, therefore, the State of Perfection can be figuratively indicated as \u0027Visvabhuk\u0027 the One who swallows all other experiences of plurality\u0027.",

Though essentially the Infinite is One, Non-Dual and All-Pervading, the Reality, when viewed through the equipments of mind-and-intellect (Maayaa) seems to have apparently become the pluralistic world. Mundakopanishad (1-6) says, \u0027He is Eternal and Multiform.\u0027 Based upon this idea we have in the Puranas, the description of the Lord\u0027s incarnations and His play in the world of the many.",

      "\n**Naaraayanah**\nThis simple sacred word has an endless number of direct and indirect meanings, imports and suggestions, and Vyasa seems to have explored almost all its possibilities. 1. The Shelter (Ayanam) for man (Nara) is Naaraayana. 2. The term Nara implies the ego-centric individuality and a large collection of them is called Naara and the One who is the sole refuge for the entire living creatures is called Naaraayanah. 3. Nara also means Eesvara and the elements (Tattvas) born out of Him are called Naara; and One who is the controller, the regulator, the very source of all Existence. in these very Tattvas is called Naaraayanah. 4. Naaraah also mean \u0027waters\u0027. According to the picture painted in the Puranas of the Deluge, wherein the names, and forms devolve themselves into their elemental waters, the Lord is objectively described as lying alone upon the waters, the Eternal baby, floating upon a banyan leaf. \u0027Holding in His Lotus-hand His own Lotus-feet, and sucking His own toe with His Lotus-lips, the Lotus child resting playfully upon a banyan leaf, floating up on the waters of the Deluge-I meditate.\u0027 It is in this sense, we find Manu interpreting the word \u0027Naaraayana\u0027. In the great devotional classic, Bhaagavatam, we find very many suggestions digged out of this sacred name; such as the \u0027Self of all bodies\u0027, \u0027the Dynamic Force behind matter\u0027, \u0027the Witness of all good and bad\u0027. All these indicate that Sri Narayana is nothing other than the Glory (Ayanam) of the Self.",

      "\n**Suchih**\nOne who is Pure. The immaculate Reality which is never contaminated by the Maayaa and its by- products is Maha Vishnu. When dirt (Mala) exists upon anything, it becomes unclean. In the Absolute Oneness there can be nothing other than itself and therefore the Fourth-plane-of- Consciousness (Tureeyam) is indicated in our Scriptures as the Transcendental Ever-Pure Self, Sri Hari.",
      "\n**Siddhaarthah**\nOne who has gained all that has to be gained and achieved all that has to be achieved. That which has to be achieved in life during an individual\u0027s existence have all been classified under four heads and they are called as the four \u0027aims of life\u0027 (Purushaartha). Theyare Righteousness in conduct, (Dharma), Wealth and Possession (Artha), desires and ambitions (Kaama), liberation from imperfections (Moksha). One who has gained all these \u0027four\u0027 have nothing more to gain as there cannot be any sense of imperfection in Him. One who has gained (Siddhah) all that has to be gained (Arthah) is Siddhaartha, Lord Vishnu.",
      "\n**Siddhasankalpah**\nSankalpa means \u0027intellectual willing and wishing\u0027. One who gains all that He wishes for, or One who immediately gains what He wills is called Siddha-sankalpah. Ordinarily we fail to gain what we demand because of the disintegration within ourselves. The Lord, the Perfect, is One who instantaneously gains all that He wishes; hence the Upanishads define Him as the Satya Sankalpavaan. This great Paramesvara of the Upanishads is the Maha Vishnu, the theme of the \u0027Thousand Chants\u0027 (Sahasranaama).",
      "\n**Siddhiddah**\nOne who is the Giver of the appropriate reward for all actions, for those who are doing spiritual practices. Lord Narayana is the great Universal Power that brings about the reward for all actions.",

Siddhi ordinarily means \u0027fulfilment\u0027, here it means all efforts at a given fulfilment. It is also interpreted by some as the One Mighty Reality, to worship at whose altar is the very means (Saadhana) for all achievements (Siddhi), and this is Sri Narayana.\n"

Subjectively, Vrisha means the residual \u0027results\u0027 gathered in the personality after each devoted and dedicated act of offering, during all Self-less services (Yajnas). Therefore, Vrishaahee means \u0027One who is a controller of all actions and the dispenser of all results\u0027, in all individual, conscious, intelligent creatures.",
      "\n**Vrishabhah**\nThe term Vrisha though not very familiar now is used in the Vedic literature to indicate Dharma-\u0027the essential nature of a thing without which the thing cannot remain as the thing\u0027 is its Dharma. One who showers all Dharmas is called Vrishabhah. In short, one who showers glowing health, burning devotion and thrilling silence on all sincere seekers and faithful devotees is Vrishabhah; and He is Sri Narayana.",

In Mahabharata we also read the Lord Himself explaining to Arjuna, \u0027Because I stand striding across the Universe (Kramanaat), O Partha, I am known as Vishnu.\u0027 -(Mahabharata 12-350-43). In the Upanishad also we read, \u0027Vishnu has spread Himself and conquered all these three worlds.",

The term Parvam means \u0027Ladder\u0027, \u0027a flight of steps\u0027 that takes us to the Higher floors (Hence Parvata means mountain). Thus, here, the term is explained as a flight of steps on the ladder of life to take one to the Ultimate Reality, the Eternal (Sanaatana) Dharma: \u00271 am the way\u0027. Vishnu is the One to worship at whose altar will facilitate the devotee\u0027s steady evolution towards the experience of the Higher consciousness.",
      "\n**Vrishodarah**\nVrisha, that which rains; Udara \u003d belly. The idea here is the seat of all-creative thinking is resting on a psychic, centre, roughly indicated by the navel, and hence we find the description that the total Creator of the universe is sustained and held aloft at the navel of Maha Vishnu. During Pralaya (sleep) the \u0027creative power\u0027 merges back to its source, and thereafter, upon waking, the creation again starts; the creative power\u0027 manifests itself and continues its creative activities, from the same point of Its merger, (Udara). This culminating point of all creation, during the time of the dissolution-which is also the same from wherein, during creation, the manifestations of names and forms spring forth (shower down \u003d Vrisha)- is Vishnu, the Supreme, and hence, He is called as Vrishodarah, \u0027the Showering Belly.\u0027",
      "\n**Vardhanah**\nOne who is the nurturer and nourisher everywhere, at all levels of life, both material and spiritual. In short, from the standpoint of the student, who is studying with devotion these \u0027Thousand names of the Lord\u0027, the term indicates that Vishnu is the Mighty Power that supplies all spiritual growth, provides all well-being and ultimately blesses all His devotees with the final Realization.",
      "\n**Vardhamaanah**\nOne who can grow Himself into any dimensions; ever-growing. Since the names and forms of the universe are ever dynamic and has the unseen movement of progressive evolution everywhere, the Lord is indicated here as this very \u0027dimensional movement of progress\u0027 (Vardhana). (The Pauraanikas attribute that this name came to Him because He in His Vaamana incarnation grew Himself to measure under His three steps the whole universe.",
      "\n**Viviktah**\nAlone\u003dsolitary. Every standing apart from everything. With reference to the dream and the dreamer, the waker is, we knew, indeed, separate.

The horrid \u0027ghost\u0027 cannot affect the innocent \u0027post\u0027. One who thus remains alone and apart, in His Own Majesty and perfection, even when the world-of-Maayaa is heaving about is Viviktah.

      "\n**Vaagmee**\nOne who is eloquent of His Glory. The full sense or the term should embrace not only the eloquence in speech, but all physical capabilities in the world, all the Glories or the cosmos, all the beauties or the heart, the total might of the intellect-all are eloquent of His Glory.

      "\n**Vasuh**\nThe term Vasu has got three meanings: Wealth (Dhana), Veil (Aacchaadana) and Sun (Aaditya); thus He is the One who manifests Himself in the form of the external wealth, for He, as the very sun, nurtures and nourishes the world. He is the One, who veils Himself from the comprehension and understanding of the unprepared men of evil temperaments and who possess no true devotion. The term Vasu also can mean \u0027One who lives in\u0027 (Vasati iti) all things and beings of the universe; or it can also mean as \u0027One who allows all things and beings to exist in Himself\u0027 (Vaasayati iti).

      "\n**Brihadroopah**\nVast of Infinite dimensions; pervading all. One whose very form (roopa) is the totality of the universe and therefore as vast as the universe, nay, in the description of the Supreme Person in the Rig Veda (Purusha- sookta) we read the Rishis declaring that Vishnu is not only of the total size and dimension of the Universe but He stands beyond it all by ten digits. – \u0027Atyatishthat Dasaangulam\u0027.",

Thus Sipivishtah would indicate the Supreme, who is the Presiding deity in the Sun, giving it both its energy of heat and light.

He is the knower, knowing everything in each bosom (Sarvavit) and knowing all things that are happening in the universe at one and the same time in His omnisciency (Sarvajnah). He is the Illuminator of all experiences. Just as the One sun illumines everything in the world the Reality illumines both the fields of experiences and the knower-of- the-field.\n"

      "**Ojas-tejo-dyutidharah**\nOne who is the possessor (Dharah) of Perfect physical virility (Ojas), all brilliancy (Tejas) and every beauty (dyuti). These three terms indicate perfection at three different levels of personality known to us at present. Ojas is glowing health (physical) due to perfect balance in the constituents (Tattvas) of the healthy body. This virility in us when conserved, disciplined and trained can, through meditation, be converted into intellectual \u0027brilliancy\u0027 and perfect personality \u0027integration\u0027. The shine of an individual, who has thus sublimated Ojas, is termed in our Sastras as tejas. A Yogi, through intelligent living and through a devoted life of continued meditation, has thus gathered to himself ojas and Tejas sufficiently, he, in time, grows to become an experienced Saint of Divine Realization, a Buddha. The enchanting atmosphere of irresistible peace and compassion, love and perfection, knowledge and strength, such a man throws around him, is called the aura of Divinity (Dyuti). In the lOth Chapter of the Geeta, the Geetacharya autobiographically confesses, \u0027I am the Might in all strength; I am the Brilliancy in all that is brilliant.\u0027 Some commentators are found to take these three terms as separate names of the Lord. However, Sankara interprets it as one single term.",

The One who is the Self in all hearts, who can be experienced as the Consciousness, which is the source of all illumination to shine upon all experiences in the three planes-of-consciousness, in all living creatures, at all times. This Universal and Absolute Self is Maha Vishnu.",
      "\n**Prataapanah**\nThe One who manifests Himself as the Essential Thermal Energy, that lends Life Potential to the very atmosphere around each living creature. In the words of the Geetacharya, we find a confirmation to thus declaration when the Lord declares to Arjuna that He Himself is the Reality that manifests as the heat and light in the Sun and the Moon, and it is He again who warms up the crust of the earth and impregnates it with its fertility. (Geeta XV-12 and 13).",
      "\n**Riddhah**\nOne who is ever full of all prosperity. As the very Lord of Lakshmi, Vishnu should be one who has all glories (Aisvarya). When the entire universe of wealth, strength and beauty is itself a manifestation from Him, He Himself must be the Absolute Glory.",
      "\n**Spashta-aksharah**\nSpashtam\u003dclear. One who is clearly indicated by the Supreme Sound (Akshara), the famous Sound-Symbol of the Eternal Lord Om. In Geeta we read: \u0027One who chants my name Om and leaves his body at the time of death thus remembering Me, he shall go to the Supreme State\u0027 In Sanskrit, Kshara means the \u0027Perishable\u0027 and Akshara means the \u0027imperishable.\u0027 The world of plurality, the \u0027perishable\u0027 is no doubt nothing other than the All-Perfect, the Immutable Truth, but due to the imperfections of the instruments-of-perception-body, mind and intellect-the perceiving ego can experience only this world constituted of a plurality-sense objects, emotions and thoughts- The ego peeping through the vehicles can never experience the One co-ordinating Reality, the Divine. When the mind is hushed and the ego thus sublimated, the Immutable Akshara-factor is experienced, wherein we gain the clearest (Spashta) understanding of the Absolute. Since it is thus clear (Spashta) only in Its Immutable nature (Akshara\u003dKootastha), Vishnu, the Supreme Self, is indicated here as Spashtaaksharah).",
      "\n**Mantrah**\nOne who is of the nature of the Mantras of the Vedas. The declarations of the Vedas the mantras are the vehicles that will take us straight into an experience of the Transcendental. The vehicles are often called by the nan1e of their destination. Mantra means that which can save us on being properly meditated upon. Only through the mantras of the Upanishads we ever come to experience the Supreme Nature of the Lord, and so He is named as Mantrah.",
      "\n**Chandraamsuh**\nRays of the moon. That the moonlight has got an effect upon the herbs was known to India in the Vedic period. \u0027As the rays of the moon (Soma) I fill the vegetable kingdom with nutrition\u0027, confesses Bhagavan Vaasudeva. Thus the Lord is One who nurtures and nourishes all living creatures instilling into each its particular vitality. Though this is the deep philosophical significance, superficially the beauty, calm and peace that the moon suggests to our mind is but a reflection of the Infinite Peace of Vishnu.",
      "\n**Bhaaskaradyutih**\nThe Effulgence of the Sun. Sun is the centre of the solar system, an eternal exchequer of energy, ever distributing Life and Strength to all living upon the earth; life would have been impossible but for the Sun. At the same time, the Sun stays where he is and he never interferes with life; from afar he blesses life. The Lord who thus from afar blesses by His mere presence is the true Sun of Life, the Atman, the Self- Sree Maha Vishnu.\n"

Lord of Time is the One, in whose presence alone, time concept is possible. \u0027Time\u0027 is the interval between \u0027thoughts\u0027 and the Awareness that illumines the rise and fall of thoughts is the very Lord of Time. Objectively He is the Lord of all those, that exist in the three periods of time; or He to whom all creatures conditioned by time, pray for comforts, solace and protection.",
      "\n**Pavanah**\nOne who purifies everything. Or One who manifests as the life-giving atmosphere around the world and sustains the existence everywhere.",
      "\n**Paavanah**\nIn the earlier term \u0027Pavanah\u0027 the Lord is indicated as the One who has, in the form of the atmospheric air, filled the universe. He is the One who sustains life in all living creatures as the life-giving atmospheric air. Here, the present term \u0027Paavanah\u0027 means the One who gives this life-sustaining power to the atmospheric air. It is very well-known that the moving air (Breeze) purifies more than any other known thing in the world. This purifying power is acquired by the atmosphere by His Grace. In short, He is the secret glory that lends the atmosphere, the very life-sustaining property for the air, and He is the dynamism that moves the air.",
      "\n**Analah**\nThe term itself means Fire. So He who is in the form of fire, and sustains life. A certain amount of minimum thermal heat is necessary for life to continue, be it in the human body or be it in the Earth itself. This warmth of life in the world around and in the organism itself, without which life cannot continue. that mighty warmth of life is none other than the Lord, and hence, He is called Analah. Also the term \u0027Ana\u0027 has the meaning of Praana, and \u0027La\u0027 means to receive. Therefore, the term can also imply \u0027One who is the very Self, the very Vital Factor, in the Praana\u0027.",
      "\n**Kaamahaa**\nOne who destroys all desires. Desires spring forth from the Vaasanaas. We can experience the Self only on transcending the vaasanaas. Just as the sun is the destroyer of night, similarly, the Pure consciousness, the Atman and the Vaasanaas cannot remain at the one and the same time. The Vaasanaas end when the Atman is experienced. From the devotees\u0027 stand-point, He is the One who fulfils all his desires. Or He who is the father of Kaama, Pradyumna, which again is one of the names of Vishnu. Desire is the source from which endless series of other sources of sorrows flow into the human life. When a desire arises in the mind, only two things are possible. Either we fulfil the desire or we do not. In case we get our desires fulfilled, it is natural for the human mind to crave for more and thus he becomes restless due to greed. If, on the other hand, the desire is not fulfilled, anger rises and when anger increases, it brings about delusion of the mind and makes the victim see things in others, in himself and the situation he is in, which are not in fact there around him. In such a deluded one, Wisdom slips away and, naturally, therefore, his discriminative power cannot function, since he cannot judge the present situation with reference to any standard ideal that he had in the past. When the rational discriminative power fades away that man falls completely off the dignity of mall and becomes worse than a brute. Geeta charters thus, a steady psychological fall in a spiritual being, and this entire chain of self-destruction springs forth from desire. A devotee, or a meditator, when he approaches this Great Reality, existing in the subjective Core of his own personality, he transcends all the realms of his desires and passions and, therefore, this Great Inner Self is indicated here as the \u0027Destroyer of all Desires\u0027. He is the One who fulfils all desires in His devotees, and thus bring about a calm fullness of joy within.",
      "\n**Kaama-krit**\nOne who fulfils all desires. The implications have been indicated in the analysis of the previous term. It can also mean as the Very Creator of the Lord of Love-Kaama Deva. Even though desires spring forth from the realm of the Causal Body, constituted of the Vaasanaas without the thrilling touch of the Self, even Vaasanaas cannot express all by themselves. In that sense of the term, the very agitations of desire, erupt from His Grace. Hence, He is called the Kaama-krit.",
      "\n**Kaantah**\nOne who is of enchanting form. Infinite Beauty is the very nature of the Self, and the Upanishads define the Self as Saantam-Sivam-Sundaram. The aestheticism in man craves for harmony and where we experience the greatest of harmony, there we detect the presence of beauty. In front of beauty, the entire personality of an intelligent man becomes calm and peaceful, hushed in silence, transported to ecstasy. These are moments when the meditator has transcended his Sheaths and is in union with the Pure Self. Naturally therefore, the Pure personality of an intelligent man becomes calm and peaceful. Self is indicated here as Kaantah-Divine Auspicious form of Absolute Beauty.",
      "\n**Kaamah**\nOne who is the beloved. Not only He is the beloved of the devotees, but every activity of all living creatures is an attempt at courting and winning bliss and happiness. The Blissful Self is the goal of all creatures in life. Even insignifical1t unicellular organisms revolt against pain, and they too seek happiness. Man is no exception. The Infinite Bliss which is experienced only on transcending the body, mind and intellect, is that which is constantly demanded by every organism that breathes in this universe. In the ignorance of this All Satisfying Goal, the world suffers. That Lord is the beloved of all devotees, and in fact, He is also the beloved of even those who deny Him and run after the sense- objects. The theist seeks Him through devotion or meditation. The atheist too seeks Him only in and through all his diligent pursuits of the sense-stimuli.",
      "\n**Kaamapradah**\nOne who supplies the desired objects; One who fulfils all desires To the devotee, the Lord, is the giver of all desired objects, and to a man of meditation, the Lord is that state-of-mind where all desires are fulfilled- in the sense that no more can any desire linger in his heart after the Experience-Divine",

      "**Yugaadi-krit**\nOne who is the creator of the divisions of aeons, described in our Puranas, as Yugas. These Yugas are four in number. Kritam, Tretaa, Dvaapara and Kali. In short, He is the Lord of Time. By the term Aadi, it must be understood to indicate all other divisions of Time as Centuries, Years, Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds. He is not only the Lord of the Yugas, but He is the Light of Consciousness that illumines the duration of each experience and the very interval between every pair of subjective experiences.",
      "\n**Yugaavartah**\nIn the previous term the Lord is indicated as the Creator of the Yugas, and here we are told that He is also the Power behind the wheel of time that goes on changing and repeating itself, i.e. not only He is the Lord of Time, but He is the Mighty Administrator of the performances of Time, the very Law behind the constant flow of the flood of time.",
      "\n**Naikamaayah**\nOne whose delusory forms are endless and variegated. According to Puranas, for the sake of sustaining the world and maintaining its order and rhythm, the Lord had taken different forms, each of His manifestations well-suited for the times of His arrival. Thus, we have ten in- carnations. Also, in that mighty manifestations of the Lord, as Krishna and Raffia, we find descriptions of how one and the same entity generated different attitudes and emotions in different types of people. In short, one who has realised the Self, can thereafter freely play through all his existing Vaasanaas and none of them can ever entangle him, because he has grown to be the master of his own Vaasanaas. Maayaa, otherwise called as Avidyaa, is constituted of the Vaasanaas in us, forming our Causal Body. One who has transcended this is the One who has realised the Infinite. Lord is therefore, one who is without Maayaa in Him. An individual entity, like us, is one who is under the tyrannies of Maayaa. The Lord is one who can wield Maayaa for His purpose without Himself becoming involved in it.",
      "\n**Mahaasanah**\nThis word can be dissolved as He who eats up everything. One who swallows up all perceptions, emotions and thoughts, created by the Vaasanaas, at the various levels of personality, due to our own individual Vaasanaas. At the time of Samaadhi when the limited ego is ended and the Supreme is experienced all the expressions of Vaasanaas are, as it were, swallowed by that Infinite Experience, and therefore, this Great Vishnu is called as the \u0027Consumer of Everything.\u0027",
      "\n**Adrisyah**\nThrough the sense-organs, the mind and intellect at this moment, we are aware of the outer objects and our subjective emotions and thoughts. The ultimate Reality is neither the objects perceived by us, nor the instruments of our perception. He is the Subjective Core, the Eternal Essence, wherein, the perceived and the instruments of perceptions are all totally absent. This Subjective Reality must necessarily be, by Its very nature, not an object-of- perception, and hence, It is called as the Imperceptible meaning, He is the very Perceiver in all perceptions.",
      "\n**Vyakta-roopah**\nHe who has a form- clearly perceptible to the meditator in his meditation. The contradiction is so smotheringly apparent because of the very placing of the term. It is only just-now, in the above term, that we are told that the Lord is imperceptible (Adrisyah) and the very following term declares that He is perceptible. Here it means that though He is not perceptible with the physical instruments of perceptions, yet on transcending the equipments, the Yogi intimately comes to experience the entire Divine Glory of the Self. Though, ordinarily it is not easy to see Him, in the devotee\u0027s heart, the Lord comes to play vividly and drives the devotee mad in his ecstasy.",
      "\n**Sahasra-jit**\nOne who vanquishes thou- sands. In all the Puranas everywhere, it is found that the Incarnations manifest to destroy the diabolically fallen (Raakshas) who approach the good in endless hoards to annihilate them. One who conquers over these diabolical forces is the Lord Vishnu. Subjectively the hosts of passions and lusts, greeds and jealousies which invade the inner bosom, and loot away the seeker\u0027s tranquillity and peace, are all ultimately vanquished by this Higher Consciousness and therefore, the Self is indicated as the one who is ever victorious over all the hoards of our lower impulses.",
      "\n**Ananta-jit**\nEver-victorious. The victory of the Lord is endless; in every Incarnation, He alone wins in the end. The victory over negative forces becomes complete when once the Higher Consciousness is experienced, and hence, the Self is indicated here as Ananta-jit.\n"

      "**lshtah**\nThis term can be interpreted in two ways. One who is invoked through the different types of Vedic rituals (Yajnas), is Ishtah. Or, it can also mean, One who is loved by all. The Lord being the very centre of all love in everyone. The Brihadaranyakopanishad very clearly indicates this idea in almost unvarnished words: \u0027The man loves his wife not because of the wife, but because of himself. ...etc.\u0027 All love spring from our personal love for the Infinite which is the Self in us.",
      "\n**Visishtah**\nOne who is the noblest and the most sacred. Vishnu, the Lord, dwells in the heart of every- one. He is the sole essence presiding over every physical, mental and intellectual activities in every living creature and, therefore, He is indicated by this term.",
      "\n**Sishta-ishtah**\nTo all spiritually minded good people and therefore sincere seekers, the Lord is the greatest beloved in-as-much as, He represents the Goal and the Destination of all devoted seekers. In short, He is the Supreme Beloved for all spiritually inclined divine hearts. He can also mean that the Lord is one who Himself is sincere and ardent lover and courtier of all devotees, sincerely and diligently seeking Him. There are commentators who indicate that the term can also mean: One who is being constantly invoked and help in adoration by all true devotees with their physical, mental and intellectual activities.",
      "\n**Sikhandee**\nOne who wears \u0027Sikhanda\u0027 meaning \u0027the peacock feather\u0027, Lord Krishna is described in Bhagavat as having adorned with the \u0027eye\u0027 of the peacock feather, especially in his early child and boy-hood.",
      "\n**Nahushah**\nThe term \u0027Nahanmn\u0027 means bondage, therefore, the term stands for \u0027One who is familiar with bondages,\u0027 ln Vedanta, the word \u0027Isvarah\u0027 is the Supreme Consciousness conditioned by the total- Causal-Body (Maayaa); at the same time, Isvara is One who has the Maayaa under His control, It can also be understood as \u0027One who bind, all creatures of the world with the cord of Maayaa.\u0027 Those who are students of the Puranas interpret this word as One whose glory was expressed in the spectacular magnificence in Nahushah, who gained the Office of Indra.",
      "\n**Vrishah**\nThere is a famous statement in the Hindu tradition from which we can gather that the Lord is of the nature of Dharma. Dharma means the essential Law of Being, that because of which an individual is an individual, without which the individual cannot exist, is the Dharma of the individual. In this sense, the essential Dharma of one is the Self. Thus, Vrishah is but another name to suggest that the Lord Vishnu is none other than the Self in us. It can also mean \u0027One who showers the fulfilment of all desires in all devotees.\u0027 Desires arise when the existing Vaasanaas get impatient and explode into manifestation. As the desire arises, the mind plans out and the body acts towards its fulfilment. All these activities are possible only when the vehicles are thrilled by the Self in us. Thus, ultimately, one who fulfils all desires is the Lord of our heart, the Atman.",
      "\n**Krodhahaa**\nOne who destroys anger in all sincere seekers. We have already found earlier that anger manifests when fulfilment of a deep desire is obstructed. On realising the Lord, all desires end and, therefore, there cannot be any anger on any occasion. Also, anger can come only when we recognise the world of plurality around us. For one who is experiencing the Self, there is nothing but the One Self everywhere and, therefore, there is no occasion to entertain this emotion of anger.",
      "\n**Krodha-krit-kartaa**\nOne who generates in a sincere and serious seeker anger against the lower tendencies when they manifest-\u0027Krodha-krit\u0027. Also He is the very creative impulse \u0027Kartaa\u0027 behind the lower tendencies; because all things come out from Him alone. Some commentators consider this term as two different words, but the majority consider them as an integrated one.",
      "\n**Visvabaahuh**\nOne who has number of hands; whose hands are everywhere doing all activities in the universe. The life in the bosom as long as it exists, so long alone the hands and the legs function. The hands can lift and do its job only when it is in contact with life. Life expressing through the hand is its function. All hands that are doing variegater activities all over the world are all His hands in-as- much as, where He is not, that lifeless hand can perform no more any activity. Since He is thus the dynamic One Principle that functions through all hands at work, He is called a Visvabaahuh.",
      "\n**Maheedharah**\nOne who is the Substratum and support for the Earth. The Lord is the very material cause for the universe and as such, He supports the world-just as cotton supports the cloth, mud supports the pot, gold supports the ornament. Since the term Mahee also means \u0027the adorations sent up by the devotees,\u0027 it can also mean \u0027One who receives all the worship of devoted hearts.\u0027\n"

      "\n**Praanadah**\nOne who gives strength (Praana) to everywhere The root \u0027da\u0027 has a meaning of destruction and, therefore, the term comprehends also the power of destruction everywhere According to the Puranas, therefore, He is the One who gives the strength and glory for Devas, and again, He is the One who supplies special strength to them to win over the brutal forces of the diabolically wicked, the Asuras Subjectively, it is the Self that supplies the mental strength for cultivating the higher values of life, and it is the same Source Divine that floods the seekers heart with the courage to annihilate the lower impulses that come to destroy his peace and tranquillity within",
      "\n**Vaasavaanujah**\nthe brother of the Indra. This name has been acquired by lord Vishnu because of his incarnation as the Adorable Dwarf-(Vaamana). At that time, the Lord had to take birth in the womb of Aditi and manifest as the younger brother of Indra. In the subjective science of Vedanta, the king of the gods (Indra) is the Lord of the sense organs and so he is the Mind. The spiritual urge that dawns in us as a younger brother of the Mind, ultimately comes to measure away and win over the three worlds of waking, dream and deep-sleep, and thus comes to conquer over the entire kingdom of Indra in more sense than one.",
      "\n**Apaam-nidhih**\nTreasure of waters, meaning the ocean. The very glory and might of the oceans are all but a reflection of Sri Narayana\u0027s own glory divine. In the Geeta, Bhagavan Himself says, \u0027among the collections of waters, I am the Ocean.\u0027",

The results of the actions are always strictly according to the quality of the actions. In administering this Law of Karma, One who never makes any mistake is Apramattah. We are full of Pramaada -we make the mistake of misunderstanding ourselves to be the matter equipment around us and due to this Pramaada, we project in ourselves the false concept of an Ego The Supreme is ever the Pure Consciousness and, therefore, He is without such wrong self-judgement.",
      "\n**Pratishthitah**\nEverything in the world depends upon something else to serve as its cause. Since all things that we perceive and experience in the world are all effects, they have their own causes, and the effects must necessarily depend upon the cause for their very existence. The Supreme Lord is the One uncaused Cause with reference to whom everything is only an effect. Since He is thus the ultimate Cause, He is not depending upon anything other than Himself. This self-established Reality is indicated by the term Pratishthitah.\n"

      "**Skandah**\nThis is one of the names of the youngest son of Lord Siva, Subrahmanya, who is described in the Purana as Commanander-in-Chief of the righteous army. Therefore, Skanda means \u0027the Lord, whose glory is expressed, through Subrahmanya\u0027, In order to realise the Self, it is a prerequisite condition that the different personality layers in the seeker should be completely integrated.",
      "\n**Skanda-dharah**\n\u0027One who upholds the withering righteousness.\u0027 Or, \u0027One who fathered Lord Subrahmanya\u0027, meaning One who is in the form of Paramesvara.",
      "\n**Dhuryah**\nOne who carries the Lord. The Lord is the One who carries the responsibilities of creation, sustenance and annihilation of the entire world of plurality. One who carries out these functions systematically without any hitch round millenniums is Sree Narayana and He is therefore Dhuryah.",
      "\n**Varadah**\nOne who blesses all true devotees and fulfils their request for boons. It can also mean \u0027One who gives the best (Varam) in life to those who seek Him with perfect detachment and sharpened discrimination.",

In the Sanskrit literature, the movement of air in the atmosphere has been classified under seven types and they are called the \u0027Sapta Marutah\u0027. In short, the inconceivable might and power of the winds and their life-sustaining abilities are all lent out to the air by His own munificence and, therefore, He is called as Vaayuvaahanah.",

Vaasu means \u0027One who dwells in the physical equipments of all living creatures as its indweller (Jeeva); Deva means \u0027One who revels or One who illumines\u0027. Thus, Vaasudevah means \u0027One who lives in the physical equipment as though conditioned by them, and yet, who is the Vital Consciousness in the light of which every experience is illumined. The Lord is the One who dwells in all things of the universe and He is at once the Supporter of the entire world. Also, directly, it can be taken to mean, One who is born as the Son of Sri Vasudeva in the Jail of Kamsa, the Blue-Boy of Brindaavana. He is called Vaasu as He veils Himself with His own Maayaa; Deva means \u0027He who sports, wishes to conquer, conducts, shines, creates and moves\u0027. In the Udyoga Parva of Mahabharata, we read, \u0027Like the Sun with his rays I am covering (Deva) in all beings and hence, I am called Vaasudeva\u0027. Vishnupurana says, \u0027\u0027as He resides everywhere in and through all things, He is termed Vaasudevah. \u0027 All beings remain in the Supreme, and He in all being and hence, the Omnipresent is called the Vaasudeva.",

The three cities through which we generally move about gathering our experiences in this world are the waking, dream and deep-sleep, On transcending the Gross, Subtle and Causal Bodies, one experiences the Self, and at such a moment these three cities are burned down or pillaged or blasted, The same ideal is explained in the Shiva-purana also; accordingly, we can say that He is One who as Mahesvara, performed the destruction of the three cities.\n"

The agitations of the mind come from desires, greed, etc. Therefore, the term Asokah indicates, \u0027One who has none of these negative tendencies that create in their turn more and more mental disturbances\u0027. This is a true appalation, because, the Lord, as the Self, transcends the realm of the thought-disturbances constituted by the mind-intellect- equipment.",
      "\n**Taaranah**\n\u0027One who enables others to cross.\u0027 The ego suffering the constant agitations of the equipments is saved by the Self. The ego (jeeva), when it discovers its identity with the Self, automatically moves away from the sorrows of the vehicles. In short, as Vishnubhaagavata says, \u0027who is there other than You that can save us from the wheel of birth and death.\u0027",
      "\n**Taarah**\n\u0027One who saves is called Taarah, One who saves from the fear of re-birth and also One who is a constant protector of the devotees and, therefore, the devotees themselves call Him as the Saviour (Taarah). These three terms indicate how Vishnu is the Absolute Protector of His devotees. He saves us from the afflictions (Asoka) of the body and so Subjective-sorrows (Adhyaatma). He enables us to cross the ocean of Samsaara (Taaranah) and, therefore, He saves us from all Cosmic pains (Adhibhootah). He saves us from the elements (Taarah), and so, He is the Saviour from all sorrows of birth and death; this indicates all trans-Cosmic tragedies (Aadhidaivika), meaning that Narayana can save us from all sorrows contributed by the hand God.",
      "\n**Soorah**\n\u0027The Valiant\u0027. All sources of strength and courage spring from the Life in us and, therefore, the Lord of the universe is called here as the Valiant-capable of crushing all unrighteous forces, however well-trenched they may be in the world.",

Since the Lord is the Essential Life in everyone, He is the friend and ally of every individual in as much as, nobody spends his life except in concurrence with his own subjective intentions and purposes. Thus, the Lord is a friend fulfilling the intentions of a murderer, and He is again the friend of another helping Him to serve the mankind, if that be his intention. Thus, He is a friend and a devoted ally to everyone since He is the mighty power behind all Vaasanaas expressing through all creatures.",

It is a fact very well known that even though a body can continue existing without visibly decaying for 50 years, once Life has ebbed away, the deadbody cannot maintain its form and it does not exist even for 48 hours intact. He who while presiding over the body nourishes and maintains it, and in whose absence the body decays and nourishes, He is the One who is the Sustainer of the body (Dehahhrit).",

Those who are meditating upon the Lord in His un-manifested State of Glory, this term is very often used. All material things are conditioned by time and all objects are, therefore, perishable. The Lord, the Self, is the Subject and is, therefore, ever Unchanging and always Imperishable.",
      "\n**Rohitah**\nThe term \u0027Rohita\u0027 means fish, and this name has come to indicate Lord Vishnu because of His first incarnation as the Fish. When the entire world was submerged in the waters of the deluge, the only living creatures that were available at that time could only be fishes. Lord could incarnate at that time only in the form of the Fish. Therefore, here the term means \u0027One who had manifested to serve the living creatures as the Fish among the fishes.\u0027",

      "\n**Daamodarah**\nThis term has come to indicate the Lord because, He is One who is known through a mind which is purified (Udara) by means of self-control (dama) and such other qualities. According to Mahabharata, \u0027We call Him as Daamodara as He is known by means of Dama.\u0027 Brahmapurana re-capitulates the incident in the early childhood of the Lord when He was tied with a cord (daama) round His waste (udara).

If the Self is not there, there can be no movement or expression of life; everything would have remained completely inert and insentient. He is the Lord who thrills the world and makes it so beautifully palpitating with life. Hence, He is called as the Agitator (Kshobhanah).",

The large-hearted, tolerant Rishis of old, could have never meant such a meaning. It could only mean \u0027that He is the Supreme Consciousness whose expressions are all the deities\u0027.

Since the term directly means only \u0027the cause\u0027, it can mean not only the material cause, but also it can suggest the instrumental-cause. In the former case it would mean \u0027He from whom the whole universe arises\u0027, and in the latter sense, the term is interpreted by some commentators as \u0027He who causes the universe to emerge out\u0027.",

      "**Vyavasaayah**\n\u0027Resolute.\u0027 Being of the nature of Pure Wisdom, there is no vacillation in Him; all irresolution is at the level of the doubting mind and the unprepared intellect. The term \u0027Vyavasaayah\u0027 also means \u0027Yoga.\u0027 In this sense, the term is used in the Geeta, \u0027The intellect of one who is practising Yoga is single-pointed without vacillation.\u0027 Again, in the same chapter criticising those who are running after enjoyment and power, Krishna says, \u0027those who are revelling in sensuality and consequently disturbing the poise of their intellect, cannot have a steady mind and consistent pursuit of Yoga.\u0027 To work persistently until the Goal is reached is resolution. \u0027To steadily apply ourselves in continuously withdrawing ourselves from our identifications with the not-Self, until we come to apprehend and experience the Self\u0027, is Yoga. Hence, commentators interpret \u0027Vyavasaaya\u0027 as \u0027Yoga.\u0027",
      "\n**Vyavasthaanah**\n\u0027The Basis or the Substratum.\u0027 The one who is the very Substratum for the entire pluralistic world; the One who orders the laws of the cosmos and administers those laws.",

The One Source into which all perceptions, emotions and thoughts retire and merge at the time of deep-sleep. In short, it means \u0027the One who integrates the plurality and absorbs it all unto Himself when the projections are ended at that time of transcendence.",
      "\n**Sthaanadah**\n\u0027One who confers the right abode.\u0027 Each living organism, \u0027according to his actions and thoughts\u0027 gathers to himself vaasanaas and according to the vaasanaas, each individual takes his birth. Thus, the One who gives (dada) the appropriate abode (sthaana) to each individual (jeeva) is called Sthaanadah. In short, the Lord is the distributor of the fruits-of-actions.",

The body, the mind and the intellect and the worlds interpreted by them are all variables and changeable. The Consciousness, which illumines all of them and makes us aware of them is, indeed, the \u0027Changeless.\u0027",

He being the very Self, nothing in fact is so \u0027clear\u0027, meaning, so self-evident, as the Pure Consciousness is in us. No experience in the outer world or in our subjective bosom would have been possible had it not been for the Light of the Self. Even the sense of individuality in us is but an image of this Awareness, which is the very Self in every living creature. It being thus the Absolute Subjective essence. It is described as \u0027the most Vivid.\u0027",

The Self being beyond body, mind and intellect, it cannot have any of the sense of imperfections or incompleteness and as such, the All-full Self must be at all times, complete in Himself. Naturally therefore He is All-Blissful. Consequently, His Nature must ever be Supreme contentment.",

      "\n**Subh-ekshanah**\n\u0027All auspicious gaze.\u0027 One whose very gaze brings streams of auspiciousness to the devotee. The Self-being beyond vaasanaas, one who realises the Self, goes beyond all sins. A devotee walking the very path and moving towards the spiritual contents, purifies himself from all sins, since he will be living a life not identifying with his body, mind and intellect.\n"

Dharma of a thing is that because of which the thing is, without which the thing is not.\u0027 This term, Dharma, has, therefore, been translated as \u0027the Law of Being\u0027 -the Dharma of the Sun is light; the Dharma of the Fire is heat, the Dharma of Sugar is sweetness. What then is the Dharma of the individual? The essential Dharma of the individual can only be the self, because, without which is the individual cannot exist, and the individual\u0027s expressions, physical mental and intellectual, are all expressions of the self through the equipment in Him. Thus \u0027Dharma\u0027 means the only self in all individuals.

      "**Svaapanah**\nOne who puts people to sleep; stupefying. Lord Vishnu as Isvara has for Himself the total Vaasanaa (Maayaa) as an equipment for His self-expression as Eesvara (Narayana). He, through His Maayaa, veils each individual and renders them ignorant of their own divine nature. This \u0027veiling-power\u0027 (Aavarana Sakti) creates many agitations (Vikshepa), due to which individuals rush out for sense-gratification. Since Isvara, thus, with His Maayaa-power deludes everybody, He gathers to Himself this epithet Svaapanah meaning \u0027the mighty stupefying force.\u0027",
      "\n**Svavasah**\nThe One who has everything under His own personal control; the totally independent. Since He is the Supreme Consciousness, all living creatures and phenomenal powers are functioning by His grace, drawing their capacities to exist and act from Him only. If He withdraws His patronage everything in this Universe must stop functioning immediately. He is supremely independent inasmuch as, though the world-of-objects needs Him, He is entirely self-sufficient and needs no world for His Existence. Thus He is totally free. The waves need the ocean, but the ocean is totally independent of the waves\u0027 existence.",
      "\n**Vyaapee**\nAll-pervading. Pervasiveness in philosophy indicates subtlety. Thus All-pervading means that which is \u0027subtler than the subtlest.\u0027 This concept is again sustained by the physical observations in the world. The cause always pervades all the effects; the gold pervades all ornaments. The entire universe is an effect and He being the Cause, He pervades all and everything at all times. Thus the All-pervading, in its suggestion, indicates that He is the Ultimate-cause and Himself in His pervasiveness is ever-present everywhere and in everything, presiding over all behaviours, actions and work, everywhere in the universe.",
      "\n**Naikaatmaa**\nMany-souled. Lord, the Infinite, though ever the one, expresses Himself as the many, while manifesting Himself, in the form of the universe. It is He, the One Great Consciousness, that expresses Himself as the creator, sustainer and destroyer-in order to maintain the play of the eternal dance, among the phenomenal things and deeds. He who becomes the Trinity is the great Vishnu Tattva.",
      "\n**Naika-karma-krit**\nThe one does many actions, as He is the one Lord of all evolution, preservation, and involation of the universe. where he is not presiding over, no activity can ever take place.",
      "\n**Vatsarah**\nThe Abode of the Lord. Not only Lord is living in each one of us our inner-Soul (Antaryaamee) but He is at once, the All-prevading Essence in which, the entire universe exists, and as such, He alone is the Abode of the creatures, He is the endless \u0027time\u0027 and the infinite \u0027space\u0027 at once. for, in the time-space field alone do things exist. the term \u0027Vatsa,\u0027 in sanskrit also means \u0027calf.\u0027 the world under discussion, therefore, can also mean \u0027one who gives away claves.\u0027 this has reference to krishna who returned to Gopas all the calves, when they were taken away by the enemy.",
      "\n**Vatsalah**\nThe supremely affectionate. One who loves his devotees extremely. Narayana is one who has got more affection towards his devotees that all the paternal and maternal love in the world put together. Supreme love is the meaning of the world \u0027Vatsalah;\u0027 Lord Narayana is Love Incarnate.",

      "\n**Dhanesvarah**\nThe Lord of wealth. Here the term \u0027Wealth\u0027 means all the good things in the universe- all objects of happiness. He is described in the Puranas as the Lord of the Goddess Lakshmi (Lakshmipati) and as such He is ever the Master-of-all-wealth. The greatest of wealth is, of course, the liberation, and Lord Narayana is the Isvara of this great wealth, He blesses the true devotees with the experience of complete liberation from the entanglements and sorrows of the vestures of matter around us.\n"

      "\n**Dharma-krit**\nOne who acts Dharma. Though He, as the Absolute Consciousness that illuminates everything, is beyond all Dharma and Adharma, Sri Narayana exemplifies what is the righteousness by His own conduct. He is, therefore, called as Dharma-Pravartaka. In the various incarnations, the Lord has exemplified how the generation should live under the ever-changing kaleidoscopic pattern of circumstances that play around us at all times.",
      "\n**Dharmee**\nThe Supporter of Dharma; meaning the very Seat of all Dharma. Just as the waves exist in the ocean; just as the cotton supports the cloth; just as all the ornaments exist in gold-so Sri Narayana, the Infinite Truth is the very essence and support of the entire universe. Narayana is the Throne at which all righteousness take their refuge. Without direct reference to Him and His Glory, righteousness has no meaning; just as law books of a country are empty pages when the Government falls.",
      "\n**Sat**\nThe Existence in all things and beings is the same ever, and it is All-pervading. The sun exists; the space between the sun and the earth exists; the ocean and the creatures therein exist; the physiological organs and their functions, mind and its activities, the intellect and its agitations -all exist. This Ever-present Principle of Existence is Sri Narayana. That which remains the same without any change in and through all changes, unaffected ever, same in the past, present and the future is called in Vedanta as \u0027Satya.\u0027 One who has all these natures is called Sat-Purusha. In the Upanishads, the Supreme Brahman is indicated as \u0027Satya\u0027 –\u0027This, O Child, indeed was Sat.\u0027 In the Geeta while describing the Changeless Factor behind the eternally changing matter, Bhagavan says: \u0027That which is the All-pervading in this world, that alone is indestructible and no one can destroy it.\u0027",
      "\n**A-Sat**\nThe Conditioned; Limited; the One who appears at this moment as the limited, conditioned, and therefore confined only to the world of plurality. That which actually is not, but apparently seems to be there, is called a delusion and this is indicated by the word \u0027 A-Sat.\u0027 In the Vedantic terminology, higher-Self (Param) is ever Immutable and Eternal, while the lower-Self (A-param) constituted of all the universe of manifested things and beings, is mutable and ephemeral. Sri Narayana Himself is, in His Apara nature, expressing as the world of the many that we today recognise around us. Bhagavan Sri Krishna confesses to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Geeta: \u0027Arjuna, I am at once immortality and mortality. I am both existence and non-existence.\u0027",
      "\n**Ksharam**\nThe Perishing. One who is the very Immutable Self in all things, that appears to suffer from constant mutation: The changeless-core in the midst of all the changes. All the changeable and variable things and beings of the Universe play in Him who is the only Substratum and, therefore, the Immutable Eternal Reality is called here as the Mutable; the changing and the dying waves are all ever nothing but the changeless ocean indeed.",
      "\n**A-ksharam**\nImperishable. In order to recognize the change, there must be a changeless entity knowing it. If one ornament is to become another, there must be indeed the changeless consistent gold permanently supporting it all the time. In the same way, there must be a Changeless Factor which must be the essential core, that holds together the pattern of the constant changes, which together constitute the play of the universe. This Changeless Factor is called Narayana. Krishna says in Bhagavat Geeta: \u0027all creatures together constitute the Kshara-purusha and the Changeless in an creatures is the A-kshara-purusha.\u0027",
      "\n**Avijnaataa**\nThe Non-knower. Here we must carefully understand the term \u0027knower.\u0027 The \u0027knower\u0027 of the emotions and thoughts is the Self, imprisoned in the body, mind and the intellect, and, therefore, functioning as the perceiver, feeler, thinker-called in the Vedanta Sastra as the \u0027Jeeva,\u0027 This individualised personality is the \u0027doer\u0027 and the \u0027enjoyer\u0027, in the calamitous world of activities. Sri Narayana is the Pure-Self, who has not been contaminated by the matter- vestures and their agitated-nature, and the consequent sorrows. Therefore, \u0027Vishnu,\u0027 the Pure-Self, is indicated here as Non- Knower (A-vijnaataa), meaning the \u0027Jeeva.\u0027",
      "\n**Sahasra-amsuh**\nThe thousand-rayed. As the Pure Consciousness, He is effulgent, and in the Upanishads we read that even the sun, moon and stars gain their effulgence from Him alone. In fact the Upanishads conclude that all living creatures are resplendent after His effulgence alone. Or, we can say that it means Sri Narayana, in the form of the Sun, illumines and nourishes the world of living creatures; because the name of the Sun in Sanskrit is \u0027Sahasraamsuh.\u0027 In praising the Lord Sun it is usual to sing of him as \u0027Sooryanaaraayana.\u0027",
      "\n**Vidhaataa**\nAll-supporter .As the final sub- stratum for everything, the Lord supports the entire universe of living creatures, and nobody supports Him, He alone is His own support. The Lord is at once the material, instrumental and the efficient causes for the universe of forms.",
      "\n**Krita-lakshanah**\nOne who is famous because of six qualities, such as glory, righteousness, fame, wealth, knowledge and detachment. Again following the Puranic literature, Sri Narayana is the one who made on His own bosom the great mark of the feet of Maharshi Bhrigu. In fact from the standpoint of pure Vedanta, the term indicates the Ever-existing Pure Consciousness which is the very goal (Lakshana) to be ultimately achieved for liberation. Lakshana also means the scriptural textbooks and, therefore, the term also can mean He who is the author (Krita) of the Scriptures (Lakshana).\n"

Nowadays, this word (Kritajna) has come to mean \u0027gratitude\u0027 or \u0027thanks-giving\u0027. It is a cheap application of this deep meaning. To express to my benefactor that \u0027I have known (Jna) what he had done (Kritam) to help me\u0027 is thanksgiving, and hence, this usage is today very popular in our vernacular.",
      "\n**Medineepatih**\nThe Lord of the Earth, Sri Narayana. The Preserver Vishnu as the husband of the inert matter, Earth, is a concept at once immensely beautiful and deep, philosophic and poetic.",
      "\n**Tripadah**\n\u0027The One who has taken the three steps.\u0027 This indicates, the Vamana-incarnation, and how He measured, in just three steps, the entire universe. The jeeva, the limited ego, meaning the seeker, has also to take three steps forward, to reach across the delusion of the three worlds of sleep, dream and waking. The meditator can measure these three \u0027worlds\u0027 in three steps and arrive at his own original Real Nature in his inner mystic experience.",
      "\n**Tridasaadhyakshah**\n\u0027The Lord of the three steps\u0027-the \u0027three steps\u0027 are waking, dream and deep-sleep. One who is the Witness of the \u0027three steps\u0027 is the Self. It can also mean that One who assumes, in His play, the three qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas-and yet, Himself, is not affected by anyone of them.",
      "\n**Mahaasringah**\n\u0027The Great-Horned.\u0027 The term indicates how the Lord in the Fish-incarnation tied the ship to his great horn and sported in the waters of the deluge.",
      "\n**Kritaantakrit**\nHe is the destroyer of the \u0027creation.\u0027 He is the Creator, in our subjective life, of the inactive (taamasa) and positive (saattvic and raajasa) vaasanaas- the sins and the merits. When the merits are more, the Lord provides a heaven for them to exist and when the sins are more, they move into the lower wombs, where sin-vaasanaas, too, get exhausted. An individual seeker when he exhausts all the above vaasanaas, rises to the realm of the Self and gets totally identified with the Self. Therefore, Sri Narayana is that State Divine, wherein all created vaasanaas (Krita) get destroyed (Anta). Thus, the end (Anta) of the vaasanaas (Krita) is called \u0027total liberation\u0027 (Kritaantam). He who is the giver of the\u0027 krita\u0027, Him- self is the giver of \u0027total liberation\u0027 (Kritaanta-krit)…. We find it also interpreted to mean that the Lord is one who has destroyed (Krindanam) Lord Death (Kritaanta) himself. One who is the destroyer\u0027 Kritaanta\u0027, in this sense we can take this term as meaning the Lord who has taken the form of Rudra, the Destroyer-Lord Siva.\n"

      "**Vedhaah**\nOne who is the Creator of the whole universe, the Supreme who is expressing Himself for the apparent function of creating the world of plurality. The Infinite Truth functioning through the Total-Mind is the Creator-Hiranyagarbha. According to Amarakosha, \u0027Creator\u0027 is called as Srashtaa, Prajaapatih or Vedhaah.",
      "\n**Svaangah**\nIt is commented upon by some, as one who is beautiful, who has well proportioned limbs. This meaning emphasises the glory and beauty of the form of the enchanting Vishnu. The same term can also be interpreted as \u0027Self-instrumental.\u0027 For the projection of the pluralistic phenomenal world, He has no instrument other than Himself. The Lord not only creates everything from Himself but He, Himself, is the instrumental cause for the world. We have already indicated earlier that in the making of anything, three causes must come into play, the \u0027material-cause\u0027 (mud), the \u0027instrumental-cause\u0027 (the pot-maker\u0027s wheel) and the \u0027efficient- cause\u0027 (the intelligent pot maker). In the case of the creation of the universe all these three causes are intrinsically the Lord alone. Thus, He is the material, from which He creates the world by Himself. This idea is expressed here when the compelling beauty of the Lord\u0027s form is being indicated by the precious term \u0027Self-instrumental.\u0027",
      "\n**A -Jitah**\nOne who is vanquished by none- unconquered-and therefore, the unconquerable in any of His incarnations. We never meet Him as vanquished in any of his confrontations with mighty evil.",
      "\n**Krishnah**\nOne who incarnated in the Yaadava tribe as the son of Vasudeva and Devakee. It is commented upon as \u0027one who served the Hindu Spiritual World in the form of Krishna Dvaipaayana\u0027 which is the full name of Vyasa, the author of the Puranas. However, Krishna also means \u0027The Dark\u0027; the one great Infinite Consciousness that plays in us constantly, because of which we are aware of our experiences, and yet, never can we directly apprehend this Source of All- life within ourselves. The Krishna is the \u0027unknown factor\u0027 that expresses through us-whose manifestations are all our physical, mental and intellectual capabilities. He is, therefore, called as the\u0027 Unknown\u0027, the \u0027Dark\u0027-Krishna.",
      "\n**Dridhah**\n\u0027The Firm.\u0027 One who is firm in His convictions, judgements, love and mercy. It is in this sense that the Bhakti Marga describes the Lord often as \u0027A-Dridhah\u0027, especially when a sinner prostrates before Him; meaning that in full repentance were a criminal to surrender himself to the Lord\u0027s Feet, the Infinite Justice even wavers and becomes anxious to help the sinner out of his mistaken notions and his consequent ugly actions. The Lord is ever vigilant to re-establish such a one in his own wisdom, which is his real nature.",
      "\n**Sankarshano-achyutah**\nDuring the great dissolution of the entire universe of names and forms, He, being the one who merges the entire plurality into His own essence-He is called \u0027Sankarshanah.\u0027 When an individual sleeps, his entire world of experiences get absorbed into himself and they all remain in seed condition in the \u0027Causal-body\u0027 as mere vaasanaas. One who never falls away from His own essential nature is called \u0027Achyutah\u0027 -one who knows no fall (Chyutih). The one expression used here for the Lord is the combination of both these terms. The Lord Narayana who absorbs the whole world into Himself at the time of the deluge, and He who never falls away from His own Real Nature.",
      "\n**Varunah**\nSince, in the evening, the sun reaches the western horizon (Varuna-Dik), the sun is called Varunah. Also after his day\u0027s functioning in the world, in the dusk he gathers his scorching rays unto himself and disappears. Like the setting sun, the Lord withdraws all the pluralistic world unto Himself. The Eternal Reality, functioning through the sun as the sun\u0027s energy and light, is described in the Upanishads as the \u0027Golden One\u0027, and hence the appropriateness of using this term Varunah for Narayana. The designation Soorya- Narayana is very familiar to the students of Purana.",
      "\n**Vaarunah**\nThe son of Varunah is called Vaarunah. Both Vasishtha and Agastya are traditionally considered as sons of Varunah. Therefore, the term indicates the Lord, who manifested himself as Vasishtha or Agastya. Where-ever there is an explosive expression of any spectacular glory of stupendous achievement, \u0027understand them all as coming out of my glory,\u0027 says Krishna in the Bhagavad Geeta. The term can also be read in some manuscripts as A - Vaarunah-meaning, according to some commentators, \u0027one whose nature is never subject to veiling.\u0027",
      "\n**Vrikshah**\nIn the Upanishads the world emerging out of the Supreme Brahman is described metaphorically as a \u0027Tree\u0027; in the Kathopanishad and in the Geeta, we read of the Samsaara- Vriksha-the Tree of Life-exhaustively described. In the Puranas, again we find, in more than 3 or 4 places, exhaustive descriptions of the world manifested from the Lord as a \u0027Tree.\u0027",
      "\n**Pushkaraakshah**\nOne who has eyes (Aksha) as beautiful as the lotus flowers (Pushkara); the descriptive epithet: \u0027Lotus-eyed.\u0027 The Sanskrit term \u0027Pushkara\u0027 also means the Universal-Space, thus, it also has the interpretation, \u0027one who is ever pervading all space.\u0027 557. Mahaamanaah –\u0027One who has a great mind.\u0027 Narayana as the Lord (Eesvara) is the Supreme Consciousness functioning through the Total-Mind, and He, with His Mind, creates, sustains and destroys, fulfilling the great game of Samsar, continuously.",

So long as the equipments of our experiences-the Body, Mind and Intellect-are roaming about in their pleasures-among objects, emotions and thoughts-our attention is dissipated and is not available for the contemplation of the Higher, the Self. Narayana is the Atman in all, and to reach Him we have to retire from the fields of our indulgences. Hence, He is indicated as the \u0027Restrained-Self.\u0027",

The Svetasvatara upanishad says: \u0027The Supreme Sakti of Him is declared to be various.\u0027 Sree represents the Energy (Paraa Sakti) in the universe.

      "**Kaamadevah**\n\u0027The Beloved Lord.\u0027 One who is a seeker must necessarily get charmed by the Glory of Sree Narayana, and by the influence of this captivating love He is to be worshipped. Thus One Who is to be loved and worshipped by the seekers who strive for the four \u0027aspirations-in-life\u0027-Purushaarthas. There is also this meaning for the term: \u0027The One Who is Pradyumnah\u0027-since Pradyumna- form is an incarnation of Kaama (Love).",
      "\n**Kaamapaalah**\n\u0027The Fulfiller of Desires of all His true devotees.\u0027 Those who in their sincere attitude and love for Him alone are surrendered unto Him, their hearts\u0027 inner longings are satisfied by Him. The same idea finds similar but varied interpretation in that Koomapaalah can imply \u0027One Who had taken the incarnation of Balarama,\u0027 for Balarama is called as the \u0027Wielder-of-the-plough\u0027 (Hala-ayudhah) or as Kaamapaalah. Thus it can also mean \u0027Protector (Paalah) of His devotees\u0027 (Kaama, meaning the \u0027Desired Ones\u0027).",
      "\n**Kaamee**\nOne who has fulfilled all His desires. Desire is an expression of an inherent sense of in- completeness-and this insufficiency unto oneself is called ignorance of the Self. The non-apprehension of Reality gives rise to endless misapprehensions of the same. Sree Narayana is the Self, the Reality, and so all non-apprehensions must end in Him, then no desires can ever remain in Him demanding fulfilment. He is \u0027One of fulfilled desires\u0027 ...Some commentators give just the opposite explanation, since the term Kaamee in Sanskrit can also mean \u0027One who has desires.\u0027 Here it would mean that Lord Vishnu is the Supreme Reality who \u0027desired to create\u0027 the world of plurality. The Upanishads roar: \u0027He desired\u0027 (Sah akaamayata). The creative urge in the Supreme is that which expressed as the apparent illusion of a playful creation of multiplicity and the endless varieties in them.",

In Sanskrit the term Kah means the Creator, Brahmaaji. In this sense, therefore, Kaantah can suggest \u0027One Who destroys even the Creator during the dissolution.\u0027",
      "\n**Kritaagamah**\nThe author of the Scriptures (Aagamas). Sruti and Smriti form the Aagamas. Or in perfect harmony with the preceding term where Lord is termed as the destroyer of even the Creator at the time of deluge, some commentators have again interpreted this term as \u0027The One Who is the inaugurator of the Krita-Yuga.\u0027 This means the Lord is One into Whom the world dissolves and from Whom the world rises up again.",
      "\n**Anirdesya-vapuh**\n\u0027Of Indescribable Form;\u0027 \u0027Of Indefinable Nature.\u0027 Since the Lord transcends the Elements and is the very cause for the three Gunas- as the pure Self, expressing Itself through the body, mind and intellect of man-it becomes impossible to describe or define His Form.",
      "\n**Vishuh**\n\u0027All-Pervading.\u0027 One who pervades the entire Visvam. In His Visvaroopa-Form in Geeta XI we have from Arjuna a description of the dazzling wonderment of Him as \u0027 All-pervading.\u0027",
      "\n**Veerah**\n\u0027The Valiant;\u0027 \u0027The Courageous- the One of heroic exploits.\u0027 The root\u0027 \u0027Vi\u0027 often means creation, radiance existence, involution or motion. One who has a1l these powers is called Veerah.",
      "\n**Anantah**\n\u0027Infinite; Endless.\u0027 That which is unconditioned by Time-Space-Substance is \u0027Infinite.\u0027 None can discover the end or such a Truth. Conditioned things will all have an end-a change from one condition to another. The Infinite is totally unconditioned, so unlimited, and naturally, therefore, changeless. Hence Narayana is Infinite.",
      "\n**Dhananjayah**\nOne who had gained through his conquest and his prowess vast wealth for the enrichment of his country. From his various campaigns, Arjuna had brought great wealth to the land. In Geeta, Lord Krishna says: \u0027I am Dhananjaya, among the sons of Pandu.\n"

      "**Brahmanyah**\nOne who is a great friend of Brahman. The term Brahman includes in its connotation the Sastra, Tapas, Vedas, Truth, Knowledge, etc. Sree Narayana is a protector and friend of all these. Here Brahman means Jeeva-a friend of all individuals.",
      "\n**Brahma-krit**\nThe One Who performs the Brahman-meaning the one who lives in Truth, who abides in Tapas, etc. He is the author of Brahman as enumerated in the explanation of the preceding term.",
      "\n**Brahmaa**\n\u0027Creator.\u0027 As the total Creative- power, it is Narayana Who functions as Creator through Brahmnaji.",
      "\n**Brahma**\n\u0027The Biggest, the Vastest, the An- Pervading.\u0027 Upanishads thunderingly declare the Brahman to be \u0027Existence-Knowledge Infinite.\u0027 The Knowledge which lifts all false perceptions of differences, pure in all its aspects, ever beyond the grasp of the senses, and that which can be experienced only in one\u0027s own Self, is called Brahman.\u0027",
      "\n**Brahma-vivardhanah**\n\u0027One who increases the Brahman.\u0027 Here, of course, the term Brahman means \u0027Austerities, Vedas, Truth, Knowledge.\u0027 These are increased in one who has earned the Grace of Sree Narayana through total surrender and constant devotion.",
      "\n**Brahma-vit**\n\u0027One Who knows Brahman.\u0027 The meaning here is one who has intuited the Vedas and their full commentaries. In Geeta (XV) we listen to the Lord declaring that: \u0027I alone am the Author of the Vedas and the Knower of the Vedas.\u0027 Brahman alone can \u0027know\u0027 Brahman just as the \u0027dreamer\u0027 can never survive to know the \u0027waker.\u0027 The knower-of-the-waker is the \u0027Waker\u0027 alone. Similarly, the individualised ego conditioned by the equipments of Body, Mind and Intellect experiences the Brahman only when it has transcended the entanglements of matter-and then the ego is no more a Jeeva but \u0027becomes Brahman.\u0027 Thus the Higher is experienced only by the Higher. Sree Narayana is the Brahman-and therefore, He alone is the Knower of Brahman.",
      "\n**Braahmanah**\nOne who has realised that the pluralistic world is a mere superimposition upon the Brahman caused by an error of judgement, and who experiences the Supreme Consciousness of the One Reality is a Braahmanah. His duty is to convey this knowledge to others with a pure missionary zeal and a higher proselytising enthusiasm. By mere accident of birth one does not become a Braahmanah. Visvamitra and others through their Tapas and Divine Experience had reached the status of Brahmin-hood, so we read in the Puranas. Narayana manifests as such mighty men of realisation, serving their generations through their teachings.",
      "\n**Brahmee**\n\u0027One Who is with Brahma.\u0027 The term Brahma meaning as before –\u0027Austerities, Vedas, Truth and Knowledge-divine.\u0027",
      "\n**Brahma-jnah**\nOne who lives ever in Brahman, and so \u0027knows\u0027 the nature of the Brahman. He, the Lord, being the very Brahman, no one knows His nature as He Himself can. The \u0027waker\u0027 alone knows the waking- the \u0027dreamer\u0027 and \u0027sleeper\u0027 can never realise and experience the waking-state until they \u0027become\u0027 the \u0027waker.\u0027",
      "\n**Braahmana-priyah**\nOne who is the beloved or and One Who is the lover of true men of full realisation, the Braahmanas. Not the caste, but the men of supreme experience-divine. The Lord is dear to them, and they too are dear to Him.\n"

      "**Mahaakramah**\n\u0027Of Great-Step.\u0027 Directly we are reminded of the Vamana-Incarnation when the Lord measured the three worlds by His three steps. It also indicates the root meaning of the term, Vishnu-\u0027The one who has the long stride-meaning, \u0027 All-pervading.\u0027 Since He is All-pervading, He reaches everywhere earlier than all others.",
      "\n**Mahaakarmaa**\n\u0027One Who performs great deeds.\u0027 The creation, the dissolution, the protection and the spread of the Knowledge-of- Truth, all these are indeed great undertakings. He alone performs them, through Maha- Purushas who have surrendered themselves unto Him-those who, in total surrender, have indeed become one with the Lord in love and being.",
      "\n**Mahaatejaah**\n\u0027Of Great Resplendence.\u0027 The Upanishads glorify Him in that even the Sun, Moon, the stars and fire have no light of their own. By Him they shine, the Giver of Light to all. In the Geeta, the Lord insists that \u0027The Supreme is the Light of all lights, beyond all darkness\u0027 and again He asserts, \u0027Understand that Light in the Sun by which the whole world is illumined, and that Light in the Moon and in the fire to be My own Light.\u0027 Here the Light of Consciousness, the Self, is indicated.",
      "\n**Mahoragah**\n\u0027The Great Serpent.\u0027 Uraga means serpent In Geeta, Bhagavan says (Among the nagas, the many-hooded serpents, I am Ananta.) Ananta is the five-headed Great Serpent also called Sesha, upon which the Lord Vishnu reclines. Again in Geeta the Lord says (Among the serpents I am Vasuki), Mythologically, this is the serpent adorning Lord Siva\u0027s ring finger, Though so small as to become a ring for the Lord, it was this Vaasuki who offered himself as the great rope in churning the milky ocean. This paradox reminds us of the Upanishadic declaration (Smaller than the smallest and greater than the greatest).",
      "\n**Mahaakratuh**\n\u0027The Great Sacrifice.\u0027 The Supreme cannot be experienced without the greatest sacrifice, the total sacrifice of the Ego, the jeeva-Bhaava. The Great Sacrifice indicates traditionally the Asvamedha Yaaga. There- fore, some commentators explain this term \u0027as one who is of the very form of Asvamedha Yaaga.\u0027",
      "\n**Mahaayajvaa**\n\u0027One Who had performed Great Yajnas.\u0027 In the Rama-Incarnation, He had performed Asvamedha- Yaaga. He is the One, by Whose Grace, all \u0027Sacrifices\u0027 are fulfilled successfully. One who performs sacrifice properly and faithfully is called Yajvaa.",
      "\n**Mahaayajnah**\n\u0027The Great Yajna,\u0027 In Bhagavat Geeta, the Lord in describing His Immanence in the world says to Arjuna: \u0027I am among the Yajnas, the Japa- Yajna.\u0027 Lord Narayana Himself is the greatest Yajna- therefore, in devotion approach Him and gain His Grace. The Japa Yajna is glorified by the Lord as the greatest sacrifice because it is both the essential means of all other Yajnas and transcends them all as an end in itself, by maintaining a constant stream of the same divine thoughts in the mind.",
      "\n**Mahaa-havih**\n\u0027The Great Offering.\u0027 The yajna is He; the very things offered to the sacred fire, the Havis, are also He. Geeta tells us, \u0027We offer to Brahman that which is Brahman, in the fire which is Brahman, and the act of offering is also Brahman.\u0027\n"

      "\n**Naikah**\n\u0027The Many.\u0027 One who, though the One, yet plays in the bosom of all the living creatures. Just as we are one entity, but our thoughts are many, the Supreme Consciousness, Sree Narayana, though One, His reflections as \u0027Jeevas\u0027 play in all mind-intellect-equipments. Because He is thus seen to be manifested in the world of plurality, He is \u0027Not One.\u0027 Again, \u0027The One\u0027 is a definition, a quality. The Lord is Indefinable, quality-less (unqualified). Hence after making the student grasp that He is \u0027The One,\u0027 where the pluralities are all merged, the teacher is immediately pointing out that He is \u0027Not even One\u0027 For, to conceive \u0027The One\u0027 is to conceive the Truth with our intellect-He is to be experienced on transcending the intellect. \u0027The One\u0027 has a meaning only with reference to the many. \u0027The One\u0027 is a relative statement. To show that the Infinite is to be \u0027experienced\u0027 by the \u0027becoming\u0027 and not by \u0027knowing,\u0027 the teacher has negated \u0027Not even One.\u0027 Sruti says \u0027The Lord sports with many forms by His Maayaa.\u0027",

Or Kah means a question: He Who is ever a \u0027question without an answer\u0027 to the human intellect-He who can be experienced only on transcending the intellect and not apprehended through intellection.",
      "\n**Kim**\n\u0027What.\u0027 Since the Lord is the final Goal to be reached, Ho is the On, Who is to be enquired into or diligently sought through constant questioning upon What is His Nature Also because the Truth is realised through this process of enquiry and discrimination-the final Goal of all \u0027What\u0027 enquiring-the Lord, is termed here a, \u0027What,\u0027 (Kim).",
      "\n**Yat**\n\u0027Which.\u0027 The pronoun \u0027Yat\u0027 means \u0027that which is self-existent\u0027 Hence in the Upanishad, we find the usage of this term frequently. It may also be noted that the pronoun \u0027Which\u0027 (Yat) denotes an already existing object Thus the Self-existence of the Supreme Reality, independent of the existence and non-existence of things in the world is indicated when Lord Sree Hari is termed as \u0027Which.\u0027",

In Geeta, Bhagavan says \u0027Om Tat Sat\u0027 are the three designations of Brahman\u0027 Or again, the term Tat can mean, \u0027That which expands all the world of plurality:\u0027",

The Lord serves for the uplift of the world whenever the creatures come to suffer sorrows created by their own immoral negative ways.",

      "**Suvarna-varnah**\n\u0027Golden Coloured\u0027 is Sree Narayana for He is, in the devotee, the pure Self; and in all, He is the very All-Illumining Pure Awareness. Mundaka Upanishad declares: \u0027When the Seer sees Him of Golden- hue.\u0027 Upon witnessing the Self-Effulgent (Golden) Being, the seer\u0027s realization is completely transforming, and \u0027then that wise one, shaking off all deeds of merits and demerits, becomes stainless, and attains the supreme State of Equipoise.\u0027",
      "\n**Hemaangah**\n\u0027One who has limbs of Gold.\u0027 The description of the Lord functioning through the orb of the Sun is well-known: Hiranmaya-\u0027of pure-golden- form.\u0027 Sruti mentions it: \u0027This Golden Person seen in the disc of the Sun\u0027… This same Upanishad insists further that \u0027Mind is Brahman\u0027 and the \u0027Sun is Brahman.\u0027 Lord Hari, as the Infinite Brahman, plays in the Sun (Soorya-Narayana)- thus the term is most appropriate.",
      "\n**Varaangah**\n\u0027With beautiful limbs.\u0027 Also, Vara can take the meaning \u0027lovable,\u0027 therefore, Sree Narayana is described here as \u0027One whose form (limbs) is supremely \u0027lovable\u0027 to the yogi-of-devotion.\u0027",
      "\n**Chandanaangadee**\nThis is made up of two terms, \u0027Joy-giving\u0027 (Chandana) and \u0027armlets\u0027 (Angada). Thus the phrase means \u0027One who has attractive armlets.\u0027 It can also be used as describing \u0027One Who is smeared with the sandal.\u0027",
      "\n**Veerahaa**\n\u0027The destroyer of the valiant heroes\u0027-in order to uphold righteousness, Lord Hari takes His Incarnations and destroys the intrepid and daring Asuras in battle. Again, it may be interpreted as One Who destroys the powerful and mighty forces of likes and dislikes-Dvandva -pairs of opposites, the hosts of our own negativities in our hearts.",
      "\n**Vishamah**\n\u0027Unequalled.\u0027 Arjuna, in Bhagavad Geeta, estimates his experience of the Lord\u0027s Cosmic Form and says: \u0027None there exists who is equal to You; how can there be then another superior to You in the three worlds, O Being of unequalled power?\u0027",
      "\n**Soonyah**\n\u0027The Void.\u0027 Here Void means the total absence of (a) the equipments-of-experiences-the body-mind-intellect; (b) the fields-of-experiences-the objects- emotions-thoughts; (c) the experiencer-attitudes-the perceiver-feeler-thinker personality. In Brahman, the Pure Consciousness, all these three (a, b and c) are totally absent as the devotee of Hari transcends them all. So the Lord, in His Infinite Nature, is \u0027without attributes;\u0027 seemingly then, He is the \u0027Void.\u0027 This is not \u0027non-existence\u0027 of the Buddhists. This is Pure Existence without the object-emotion-thought world-the Self, Sree Narayana.",
      "\n**Ghritaaseeh**\n\u0027One Who has no need for any good wishes from anyone.\u0027 The Infinite Lord, perfect and transcendental, has no need for any of the objects of the world to make Him complete since the state of incompleteness is indeed the springboard for all desires to gush forth. It can also mean one who has eaten away the ghee stolen from the cow-herds\u0027 store-rooms in Brindavan.",
      "\n**Achalah**\n\u0027The non-moving.\u0027 Either it can signify One Who never falls and therefore does not move away from His own Infinite nature, or it may mean that since the Lord is All-Pervading, He cannot move as there is no place where, at any time, He is not. He is Ever-Present everywhere.",
      "\n**Chalah**\n\u0027Moving.\u0027 By the juxtaposition of these two opposite qualities, we are reminded that the apparent world of plurality that constitutes the realm of change is also nothing other than the immovable Atman interpreted through our personal equipments of experiences. Unconditioned by the body, mind and intellect, the Lord in His Infinitude is motionless, but as conditioned by the vehicles He apparently seems to move. We have already explained this relationship earlier. It is something like a traveller, though himself sleeping, is able to travel all the night since he is conditioned by the vehicle which carries him.\n"

      "**Amaanee**\n\u0027One who has no false vanity.\u0027 Since He knows His own real divine nature, He has no false identifications with the equipments of not-Self such as the flesh, the emotions or the thoughts.",
      "\n**Maanadah**\n\u0027One who gives, or causes, by His Maayaa the false identification with the body.\u0027 The Sanskrit term \u0027maana\u0027 can also mean \u0027honour,\u0027 and therefore, \u0027maanadah\u0027 can mean One who honours all His true devotees. The root \u0027da\u0027 in Sanskrit means \u0027blasting\u0027, and therefore, the same term can also mean one who blasts all false notions from the bosom of his devotees.",
      "\n**Maanyah**\n\u0027One Who is to be honoured.\u0027 He is the most worshipful as He is the very material Cause for the world of plurality. Bhagavan Sankara says: \u0027If he, who has realised the Supreme, is so blessed and to be honoured in this world,\u0027 how much more worshipful is the Lord who is the very substratum and support of the whole universe and by whom all are blessed and inspired to gain their experiences in the world of things and beings!",
      "\n**Lokasvaamee**\n\u0027Lord of the Universe.\u0027 Here the word \u0027loka\u0027 in Sanskrit means \u0027field-of-experience.\u0027 The One Who is the Controller, Director, Who is the Lord and Governor of all fields-of-experiences of all living creatures, at all times, everywhere, is the Consciousness that illumines matter. Therefore, the term Loka-svaamee is extremely appropriate.",
      "\n**Thriloka-dhrik**\n\u0027One Who is the support of all the three worlds.\u0027 Apart from the usual concept of the three worlds: heaven, earth and hell, there is a deeper import of the term \u0027loka\u0027. It should mean the three fields of experience constituted of waking, dream and deep sleep. Atman, the Self, as Consciousness, is the One that supports all these three states inasmuch as, without this kindling support of life in the bosom, it would be impossible for us to have any experience.",
      "\n**Sumedhaah**\n\u0027One who has Pure Intelligence.\u0027 In fact, the term may denote a special power in the human intellect which is the capacity to remember and repeat what has been once experienced before. As such, the term indicates that the very nature of the Self is not a knowledge newly gained, but it is only a remembrance of the seeker\u0027s own real nature, which the seeker in his earlier confusion had forgotten. So long as we have not invoked this great power of memory of our real nature, we shall continue to grope in our sorrows created by our misconception. On realising the Self, it is not that we gain anything new, but we re-discover our own essential Self. Naturally, therefore, with reference to our present forgetfulness, the ultimate goal is indicated by the pregnant term \u0027Divine Memory Power.",
      "\n**Medha-jah**\n\u0027Born out of sacrifices.\u0027 \u0027Medha\u0027 means sacrifices like Asvamedha Yajna. In such a sincere and great ritual, He is invoked and in His Pure Presence there in the sacrifice, we can say He is born. The Geeta meaning of \u0027sacrifices\u0027 (Yajna) is \u0027a co-operative endeavor wherein: -we offer our capacity into a field of chosen work invoking in It the unmanifested Lord Who pours forth His blessings in terms of profit.\u0027 In this sense, when all the personality layers are offered in an act of total surrender, the spiritual experience of the Self is born. To the student of Vedanta, the term is rich in its suggestiveness.",
      "\n**Dhanyah**\n\u0027Fortunate.\u0027 As He has no objects yet to be fulfilled, or any of His wishes not already fulfilled, He is indeed one who is utterly fulfilled. The state of the Self is an eternal state of total contentment.",
      "\n**Satyamedhah**\n\u0027One whose intelligence never fails.\u0027 He is the supreme Power of Discrimination, never deluded by the finite world of appearances, but is, in all circumstances, ever rooted in the Truth that He alone is the world of multiplicity.",
      "\n**Dharaadharah**\n\u0027The sole support of the earth.\u0027 The earth here stands for matter; and the very essence from which matter has come to express itself, both in its gross and subtle forms, is the Self, Narayana, and therefore, He is considered as the very substratum for the play of matter (earth). Geographically, the earth is supported by water. Water is supported by the atmospheric air and the atmospheric air by the space. The daring enquirer may still continue the question and investigate into the source of space. We know that the space is a concept which we experience in our intellect. All experiences of the intellect are established in Conscious- ness and, therefore, the ultimate support for the entire \u0027world\u0027 is the Supreme Narayana.\n"

      "**Tejo-vrishah**\n\u0027One Who showers Radiance.\u0027 In the outer cosmos the Sun gives out heat and light, and because of this, rain and cultivation are possible-not directly because of the Sun, but due to the sum-total-result of an endless chain of cause-effect links. In the same way, He Who by His mere presence illumines the experiences of all living creatures with His Light, is Sree Narayana, the Self.",
      "\n**Dyutidharah**\n758. -The term \u0027Dyuti\u0027 indicates the glow of beauty and strength in a form; thus the term means \u0027One Who bears an Effulgent Form.\u0027 The expression also discloses that the seat of Pure Consciousness is described as \u0027the Bearer of Radiance\u0027 for it is in the light of the Atman that creatures become aware of all their perceptions, emotions and thoughts.",
      "\n**Sarva-sastra-bhritaam-varah**\n\u0027The best among those who wield weapons.\u0027 Since Sree Narayana is described in the Puranas as wielding the Discus (Sudarsana), it, being the greatest of all weapons, justifies this term. Also, the Lord never uses His weapon of annihilation indiscriminately-for He is ever supremely just. It is also significant that all destructions in nature are always \u0027constructive destructions\u0027, therefore the Lord\u0027s Discus is itself called \u0027the auspicious vision\u0027 (Sudarsana). In the maturity of one\u0027s evolution when one becomes fit for one\u0027s own inner unfoldment, slowly, but irresistibly the seeker can ever detect a secret hand that diligently cuts off all his connections with the outer world, and compels him to lean more and more on the higher. Our Puranic literature is replete with instances, and, without exception, in all of them Sree Narayana is described as using His weapon to destroy the devilish-and to give him Moksha! –\u0027the Auspicious Vision\u0027: Su-darsana. Others, when they employ their weapons of destruction, the result invariably end in a sad \u0027destructive destruction\u0027, and, therefore, to invoke Him as \u0027the best among those who wield weapons\u0027 is most significant for a seeker.",
      "\n**Pragrahah**\nOne who is the sole receiver of all the worship of every devotee, irrespective of his creed or race, or his location in the world, at all times. The devotee may invoke the spiritual presence in various institutions, using different symbols, believing in his own creed and scripture, but, whoever he be, when he comes to transcend his vehicles of perception, feeling and thinking, the experience of the Self (God) should be universally one and the same-as God is All-Pervading and Changeless. This great factor-transcendental IS the Self, Sree Narayana, and therefore, He is the ultimate, sole Receiver of all prayers that rise consciously or unconsciously in every heart, be it from a plant, an animal or a man. The term \u0027Pragrahah\u0027 is used in Sanskrit to mean the reins with which horses are controlled and their movements regulated. In this sense when we reflect, the metaphor of the chariot In the Upanishad suddenly comes in front of us. In this famous scriptural metaphor, mind is the rein by which the steeds of the sense-organs are controlled and regulated. Here Lord Sree Narayana Himself is invoked as \u0027Pragrahah\u0027 because when the mind has turned in devotion to His feet, the devotee need not strive to control his sense-organs, but the Lord\u0027s own glory shall imperceptibly do the job for His beloved seeker. There- fore, a truly devoted heart in its utter surrender, calls the Lord \u0027\u0027as the very controller of his sense-organs.\u0027",
      "\n**Nigrahah**\n\u0027The killer.\u0027 An uninitiated student may get shocked when he finds that the Lord is invoked as a murderer! But it is true. The only difference is that He is only the destroyer of the ego-just as a doctor is a \u0027murderer\u0027 of diseases; just as the sun is the destroyer of the night; as summer is the annihilator of winter. Similarly, the Lord is the destroyer of ego and ego-centric limitations in the devotee. In Sanskrit this word also indicates \u0027One who absorbs the devotee unto Himself.\u0027 Once an individual withdraws himself even a wee bit from his total pre-occupation with the world and turns his attention to the spiritual centre in himself, the Lord fascinates and enchants the seeker\u0027s attention more and more to His own Infinite Glory, and ultimately \u0027absorbs (Ni-grahah) the individual totally into the state of Pure-Consciousness.",
      "\n**Vyagrah**\n\u0027One Who is ever engaged in fulfilling the devotee\u0027s desires.\u0027 Desire arises in the human mind due to a sense of imperfection in oneself. In the absolute sense of bliss and peace, which is the true nature of Sree Narayana, there cannot arise any desire and, therefore, He is described as \u0027the fulfiller of all desires.\u0027",
      "\n**Naika-sringah**\n\u0027One Who has many (na-eka\u003dNaika) horns.\u0027 To a modern student it would look fantastic and even foolish should one worship his Lord, the God, as One with many horns. This mental shock can even stun him when he understands also that his Lord has three legs: \u0027Chatvaarah Sringaah Trayo Asya Paadaah,\u0027 says the Maha Upanishad. If the literal translation shocks the student, the very jolt prods him to a more vigorous enquiry. The four horns mean the four States of Consciousness-the waking, dream, deep-sleep and the fourth plane of consciousness, the Pure Awareness. The three feet (paada) indicate the three states of consciousness in which we now revel in our gross, subtle and causal bodies respectively.",
      "\n**Gadaagrajah**\n\u0027The elder brother of Gada.\u0027 Lord Krishna had a younger brother whose name was Gada. The term Gada has also the meaning in Sanskrit of \u0027mantra.\u0027 Mantra are chanted and therefore Gada can indicate \u0027mantra, -\u0027Gadyate iti gadah.\u0027 A commentator insists that Ni-gada means mantra, but the prefix Ni gets dropped, so Gada means mantra. Naturally, \u0027Gadaagraja\u0027 would mean One who manifests or is invoked through mantras.\n"

      "**Chatur-moortih**\n\u0027Four-Formed.\u0027 The Lord, the Infinite is considered as having four forms-meaning that He, in His manifestations in the world, takes these four forms. The Puranas have declared that the incarnations of the Lord in the various Yuga, were of different colours: white in Krita Yuga, red in Tretaa Yuga, yellow in Dvaapara Yuga and dark (black) in the Kali Yuga. But according to Vedanta, the Lord, the Self, has four distinct expressions in the subjective life of each individual: the Waker, the Dreamer, the Deep- sleeper and the Pure Self. In the microcosm these are called as Virata, Taijasa, Prajna and Tureeya, and in the macrocosm, the Lord\u0027s complete expression, in the total gross, subtle and causal bodies, is called as Viraat, Hiranyagarbha, Eesvara- and, beyond all bodies as the Eternal Paramaatman.",
      "\n**Chatur-baahuh**\nLord Narayana is represented as having four hands. These represent the four factors that together constitute the inner equipments in man- mind (Manas); intellect (Buddhi); thought flow towards objects (Chitta) and ego (Ahamkaara). These are the four agents by which all the physical activities are controlled, regulated and constantly commanded from within the body.",
      "\n**Chatur-vyoohah**\n\u0027One Who expresses himself as the dynamic centre in the four Vyoohas. A \u0027Vyooha\u0027 is a whirlpool of activities made by a large number of imperfected forms, commanded by a pivotal person who remains in the centre of the whirlpool-just as a battalion functions under the orders of its commander. It is shown in this analogy that the Lord, the central Source of all activities, is manifest as the universal Force which blesses every engagement and contact of a living man with his outer world. In the Aitareya Upanishad, the four Vyoohas (or persons) are mentioned: the person in the body, the person in the Chhandas (Vedic mantra), the person in the Vedas and the Great Person.",
      "\n**Chatur-gatih**\n\u0027The ultimate goal of all the four.\u0027 Though their means and purposes appear divergent, Sree Narayana alone is the inevitable goal of all activities of the four types (Varnas) of men: Thinkers (Braahmanas), Rulers and Leaders (Kashatriyas), Men of Commerce (Vaisyas) and Workers (Soodras). The Lord, also, is the consummate goal to be achieved by the four stages (Aasramas) of life: the Age of Study (Brahmacharya), the Householder (Grihastha), the Retirement (Vaanaprastha) and the Stage of Renunciation (Samnyaasa).",
      "\n**Chatur-aatmaa**\nThere is also a reading as Chatvaraatmaa. In the former reading, the definition suggests \u0027the clear-minded\u0027-meaning the Lord is one who is completely free from desires, passions, vanities, in short, free from all maladies of ego in His essential Nature. In the latter term, the meaning signifies that Sree Narayana is the one Infinite Effulgence which expresses Itself as the four aspects of our inner equipment (Antahkarana Chatushtaya).",
      "\n**Chatur-bhaavah**\n\u0027The Source of the four.\u0027 One who is the Source for the four types (varna), for the four stages-of-life (Aasrama) and the four human aspirations (purushaartha). The human aspirations as codified by the Sanaatana Dharma are again four in number. Righteousness (Dharma), Wealth (Artha), Pleasure (Kaama) and Spiritual Liberation (Moksha). Lord Krishna reveals in the Bhagavad Geeta: \u0027 All the four types in creation have come from Me.\u0027",
      "\n**Chatur-veda-vit**\n\u0027Knower of all the four Vedas.\u0027 The Lord is the very theme discussed and expounded in the four vedas. The student of the vedas when he realises the Lord, then only he fulfils his study of them. In this sense of the term, Bhagavan proclaims in the Fifteenth Chapter of Geeta: \u0027I am verily that which has to be known in all the Vedas: I am indeed the author of the Vedas and the \u0027knower\u0027 of the Vedas am I.\u0027",
      "\n**Eka-paat**\n\u0027The one-footed.\u0027 The term \u0027paada\u0027 in Sanskrit has two meanings: a \u0027part\u0027 and a \u0027foot.\u0027 The Lord, in Bhagavad Geeta, uses the first meaning to describe His mighty Glory: \u0027The whole universe\u0027 is supported by one part of Myself.\u0027 There is a reference in the Taittireeya Aaranyaka which clarifies the latter meaning: \u0027All beings are His foot.\u0027 The significance here is the ~me as in Geeta-wherein even the totality of all universes cannot be compared to Him, the Infinite Absolute Existence.\n"

Even though, in the majority of us, there is a preponderance of the lower urges, in the patient grinding of time, the evolutionary goal ultimately wins and irresistibly pushes each one of us towards the altar of the Self. Battles may be lost but the war in the end is won by the Lord of our heart.",

The term \u0027Atikromah\u0027 means \u0027going beyond\u0027, therefore the term, as it stands, indicates \u0027a state beyond which no one can go\u0027-meaning Sree Narayana is the final and the absolute destination of all evolution He is the transcendental Reality and other than He there is no more a beyond to he achieved",
      "\n**Dur-Labhah**\n\u0027One who is obtained with consummate effort.\u0027 The final destination of all evolution is He, the spiritual perfection. Therefore, He is only gained after millenniums of slow evolutions, from the insignificant unicellular existence to the status of man, and the fulfilment of man\u0027s evolved, rational life is the state of Godhood. The reward for all the slow and steady efforts of evolution is bestowed when an organism reaches the height of the rational human being; and, thereafter, through selfless, dedicated service, deep and individual devotion, and sincere and serious study of the scriptures, man learns to remove his mind from all his worldly pre-occupations and brings himself to finally realise his divine Godhood. Indeed, the state of Narayana- Consciousness is an experience that is to be obtained with consummate effort.",
      "\n**Dur-Gamah**\n\u0027One Who is realised with great difficulty.\u0027 In Bhagavata there is a statement that the Lord is easily obtained (A-dur-gamah). For those who have not already developed extreme meditative abilities in their devoted hearts, the processes of self development, when studied from a book or heard from a teacher, the immediate reaction in the bosom of such students will be that it is very difficult. But as he marches forward in his saadhanaa he gains the further guidance and inspiration to \u0027go-forward.\u0027 More bounteous aspects on him beam and the \u0027kindly light\u0027 leads him safely to the goal through all obstacles. A candle or torch can at best light up only ten or fifteen yards in front of a traveller. It can never illumine the whole path of one or two miles at a stretch. He has to start and proceed as far as he can see and as he marches ahead the forward stretches will be illumined.",
      "\n**Dur-Gah**\n\u0027Not easy to storm into.\u0027 The term is used in Sanskrit to indicate a fortress; therefore the suggestion is that the essence of the Lord, Sree Narayana, is fortressed around by the matter vestures and their objects of fascination. Attracted by them, our attention is always distracted towards the joy contents in them. This seducing power of the matter vestures is itself the mighty Maayaa, which only very rare, courageous and blessed ones are able to cross over. Bhagavan Himself says: \u0027Mama My Duratyayaa….\u0027 The Upanishads say that the truth, Narayana, cannot be perceived by the senses, imagined by the mind or thought of by the intellect. These being the only source of our knowing, it almost impossible to realize the Truth. It is only an all-out suicidal attack that enables some rare ones to storm the fort and reach the Goal. Hence to an extrovert man, the seat of Consciousness apparently seems to be impenetrably fortified. The direct meaning here indicates the great Lord seated in our heart who is \u0027not easily realized.\u0027",

      "**Udbhavah**\n\u0027The ultimate source\u0027- the very spring of Creation. In the Puranic view of the term, it may mean One Who has by His own free-will manifested Himself by Himself for the service of mankind, or, it may designate subjectively, the Self, Sree Narayana, as the one dynamic Witness in Whose Presence alone the vital activities of life gush forth into expression.",
      "\n**Sundarah**\n\u0027Of unrivalled beauty.\u0027 In almost all religions the Infinite Lord is described as one having the most enchanting beauty. When we experience beauty in the world, we are moved to consider its beauty either by the pro- portion or the symmetry, or th~ tender charm in the object of observation. Within the mind of the observer, there reflects for a moment the rhythmic grace in the proportion, the smooth peace in the symmetry, or the joy of ecstasy which ripples out from the object into the contemplative eye. In all these conditions, the observer\u0027s mind, sensitive to the aestheticism in him, quietens, and, it is at such moments of supreme inner satisfaction, the flashes of \u0027beauty-experiences\u0027 floods the bosom. Remember, beauty is not in the object nor is it in the mind. The enchanting occasion silences the mind that is now available for the aesthetic reaction which resultingly fills the observer- and this is nothing but the manifestation of That which is behind the mind, Sree Narayana. Hence, the Infinite Reality is glorified in the Upanishads as \u0027Peace-Auspiciousness-Beauty\u0027. ( Saantam-Sivam-Sundaram} .",
      "\n**Sundah**\n\u0027Of Great Mercy.\u0027 Whatever be the amount of vaasanaas hoarded in our personality, due to our ego-centric, extroverted activities, once a devotee turns unto Him in total surrender, all the vaasanaas are purified and he comes to move more and more towards Him-as though, in infinite mercy, He forgives all sins that a man might commit in his innocent ignorance (Avidyaa).",
      "\n**Ratnanaabhah**\n\u0027Of beautiful navel.\u0027 Text books of Bhakti-cult advise devotees that they should meditate upon the Lord\u0027s navel-point, as a flashy, brilliant jewel (Ratna). This point of concentration is not without significance. The mystics of India long ago explored the percentage of human action that is grossly manifest at the physical level. Today also, psychologists confess that they have no other knowledge beyond the obvious fact that thoughts express themselves as actions. But deeply meditative mystic enquirers delved deeper to detect and chart the story of actions. In their adventurous explorations, they discovered that in seed form all thoughts are with the Infinite (Para) before manifestation. From this womb they become manifest and an individual becomes dimly aware of thoughts in their embryo form-vague and still incompletely un-formed (Pasyantee). Thereafter, the thoughts get translated into expressions (Madhyamaa) and in their last full stage of manifestation they come to express themselves as actions in the outer world (Vaikharee). In this chain of processes when thoughts become manifest for the thinker, it is said the seat of Pasyantee-stage is the navel region. This brilliant seat of nascent manifestation of all thoughts is indicated here as \u0027the jewel of his navel.\u0027 Generally, the intelligent student would readily jump to the conclusion that this truth is merely a poetic exaggeration, but there is a deep significance in it indeed.",
      "\n**Sulochunuh**\n\u0027One Who has the most enchanting eyes.\u0027 The term indicates the beauty of the Lord\u0027s eyes for those devotees who turn to the Lord\u0027s form. To the deeper students of contemplation, the eyes are great not be- cause of their form, colour or expression, but because of their ability to see constantly the infinite purpose and goal of the entire creation. Therefore, the term means. \u0027One who has the wisdom of the Self.\u0027",
      "\n**Arkah**\n\u0027One Who is in the form of the Sun.\u0027 The Sun is worshipped as a Vedic deity, even by the Creator Himself-hence, the term suggests \u0027most worshipful.\u0027 The Sun-centre of the solar system-is the one source of light and energy illumining and nourishing everything. The Infinite Consciousness, Sree Narayana, is the Sun by Whose Splendour the experiences of all people are illumined, at all places and at all times. He, as the One Life, thrills all living creatures and presides over, in and through their nurture and nourishment. Once He has left from therein, that body cannot be maintained -though we witness today the experiments of medical science to do so.",
      "\n**vaajasanah**\n\u0027The giver of food.\u0027 The one Vital Force that ultimately sustains, supports and nourishes all living creatures in the Universe is the Supreme. and Its Nature is not really different from the Lord, Sree Narayana. In the Bhagavad Geeta the Lord describes Himself as manifesting through the sun as the sunlight which penetrates the earth to fertilise it. The fertility of the soil, in turn, becomes the plant on the surface into which the Lord transfuses the food value of the vegetable world by the essence of moon- light from the moon. Further, in the Upanishads, we find indicative declarations that offerings, given in the worship of Fire themselves come down as a reward in the form of rain and plenty for the society. Again, it is a law of life that each individual is supplied with the exact type of \u0027equipments for experiences\u0027 and each one also finds himself in the precise environmental circumstances for their expression according to the texture and type of vaasanaas in him. Thus, in the larger sense, the entire world of \u0027emotions-feelings-and-thoughts\u0027 constitute the total food (Annam) for the experiences of the body, mind and intellect.",
      "\n**Sringee**\n\u0027The horned one.\u0027 This is generally commented upon as reminiscent of the Lord\u0027s Incarnation as a Fish. It would have been happier had it been reminiscent of the Boar-Incarnation which Sree Narayana took to lift up the world from its slushy condition to the plane of dry-surfaced earth.",
      "\n**Jayantah**\n\u0027The conqueror of all enemies.\u0027 No force could ever vanquish Him who is \u0027the Source of all energy and strength\u0027-the Almighty. Sree Narayana is acclaimed as the conqueror, because it is by His Grace and direct help that the gods always win against the \u0027diabolically bad\u0027 (the Asuras). In our bosom it is the grace of the mind and intellect, in attunement with the Self, that helps us to conquer our lower impulses, our endless desires for the sensuous-and our craving for the cruel pleasures of indulgence.",
      "\n**Sarvavij-jayee**\n\u0027One Who is at once Omniscient (Sarvavit) and victorious (Jayee).\u0027 The term, however, is not two words and, therefore, as a single expression, we can also understand it to mean, \u0027One who is victorious over all men of wisdom.\u0027 Prattlers of wisdom, however eloquent in their discussions, must become utterly silent in their moments of Samaadhi, in the presence of the Self, Sree Narayana.\n"

Lord, the Self, is a state of existence wherein neither the subjective disturbances of the mind, nor the objective persecutions of the sense-organs can ever reach to ruffle the quietude and peaceful grace of His perfection. In describing the state of the Sthitaprajna, Bhagavan says in the Geeta that such a one will be Akshobhya like the ocean: \u0027He attains Peace into whom all desires enter as waters enter the ocean, which filled from all sides, remains unmoved; but not the \u0027desirer-of-desires.\u0027",

The immediate animation to the equipment is given by the \u0027inner instruments.\u0027 Therefore, for all the sense-organs, the mind-intellect-equipment is their immediate Lord. But these subtle instruments themselves get their dynamism to act only in the presence of Sree Narayana, the Consciousness. Therefore, it is most appropriate to invoke Him as the Lord of Lords in all living creatures. The term Vaageesvara (Lord of Speech) is often used in the language to indicate poets, writers and orators. Therefore, the term can also be interpreted as \u0027the Lord from whose altar all ordinary speakers draw their powers.

      "\n**Mahaabhootah**\n\u0027The Great Being.\u0027 He is the Source from which even the Great Elements spring forth into existence and, therefore, in His Infinitude and Pervasiveness, Lord Narayana is called \u0027Mahaabhootah.\u0027 The entire play of birth and death, of integration (sanghaata) and disintegration (vighaata) are taking place in Him Who is the mighty substratum and, therefore, it is very appropriate that the Lord, the God, is considered by the devotees as the \u0027Great Being.\u0027",

To I retrieve the mind from the sense-objects and to peacefully let it settle in contemplation of the divine nature and the eternal J glory of Sree Narayana, the Self, is to exhaust all the existing vaasanaas, which are the personality-impurities within.",
      "\n**Anilah**\nLike the atmospheric air the Lord is the life-giver everywhere, and also He is All-pervading.

At the same time Sree Narayana, the Self, is the very Life which has made possible the entire manifestation of the world. Still, by His own playful inscrutability we recognize Him not. Interpreted in another sense, the term can also mean, \u0027He who is above all.\u0027 The nobler, the mightier power which controls and regulates any organised set of activities, when it is conceived by human intellect, it is always expressed as something higher or above.

Even when they are dead, their bodies are carried in moonlit procession to the burial ground, where under the tree\u0027s dancing leaves, a play of light and shade splashes a wizardly pattern upon each lifeless face. The children of each departed one, in their turn, repeat the unending cycle of life under the shade of the same old tree whose nodding grimace mocks the procession of fleeting joys and sorrows.

It sets forth the idea that the Light of Consciousness beams out through seven points in the face of a living entity-two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and the mouth. As intelligent beings, powers of perception metaphorically flame out through each one of them, illumining the world for us. The one in our heart, Sree Narayana, Who totally manifests as the seven distinct tongues-of-flame is classified here by the scientific-poets, the Rishis, in the language of lyrical service as Sapta-jihvaah.",

All things having a form are perishable. Narayana who is Infinite and Eternal is thus ever Formless.",
      "\n**Anaghah**\nThe Sanskrit term Aghah means sin or sorrow. Therefore the term means one who is sinless or sorrowless. Lord Paramesvara, the Self, is Immaculate-untouched and uncontaminated by the Vaasanaas. He is Eternal Bliss-beyond all traces of sorrow.",

Therefore, Sree Narayana, as Eesvara, is the One into Whom the total world of experiences merges when the Total-mind rests during the \u0027pause\u0027 between two busy cycles of Creation and involvement in the projected world of thoughts-feelings-objects. In the north this term is read as Avyayah where the meaning is clear: \u0027Immutable\u0027: and needs no explanation.",
      "\n**Svasti-dah**\n\u0027One Who gives Svasti to all His sincere devotees.\u0027 A true devotee is one who has discovered his fulfilment in seeking and gaining the Infinite Bliss that is Sree Hari. Naturally, he comes to turn away from the realms of inauspiciousness. To the extent he is able to move into the Hari-Consciousness, he is to that degree in the Bliss- Experience. Therefore, the Lord is termed as the \u0027Giver-of- Auspiciousness.",
      "\n**Svasti-krit**\nAs in many earlier terms which were preceded by the suffix \u0027 Krit,\u0027 here also, it expands into two meanings: \u0027One Who brings Auspiciousness\u0027 -or \u0027One who robs all Auspiciousness.\u0027 To the seeker who is moving towards the Narayana-Consciousness, his experience is of added joy and peace in life, but the one who seeks only sense-gratification and so moves away from the Reality, to him the experience is more and more sorrow, agitations, tears and tragedies-total inauspiciousness. The indeclinable (Avyaya) Sanskrit word \u0027Svasti\u0027 means Auspiciousness.",
      "\n**Svasti**\n\u0027One Who is the Source of all Auspiciousness\u0027 -as He is Himself the Auspicious. In essence His Nature is Sat-Chit-Aananda so there can be no cause for inauspiciousness therein. The individual functions within the powers of His avidyaa and so is under the infatuation of Maayaa, while the Lord rules over Maayaa and plays out through Maayaa.",
      "\n**Svasti-bhuk**\n\u0027One who constantly lives in His Experience a perpetual sense of holy Auspiciousness\u0027-as it is His very nature-divine. It can also be interpreted as \u0027One Who showers Grace and makes His devotees constantly experience Auspiciousness in their loving Narayana- centred hearts.\u0027",
      "\n**Svasti-dakshinah**\nLord is ever engaged in smartly distributing Auspiciousness. The word \u0027Dakshinaa\u0027 has, apart from the meaning of \u0027gift,\u0027 also a meaning: \u0027One who is efficient and quick.\u0027 Therefore, the term indicates that Sree Narayana quickly and efficiently will reach His sincere seekers to give them the experience of Auspiciousness which is the Lord\u0027s very nature.\n"

      "**Akroorah**\n\u0027Never-cruel.\u0027 Cruelty comes from anger, and anger rises from \u0027desire\u0027--craving or lust. Sree Narayana, the Fulfilled and the All-Full, cannot have \u0027desire\u0027 from which could come anger-thus, naturally, never any cruelty. Generally this term is interpreted as \u0027One who is of the form of the Yaadava, Sree Akroora.\u0027 Akroora was a great devotee of the Lord upon whom were bestowed many divine powers. \u0027Wherever, there is any special glory in anyone, know that to be a manifestation of a part of my Splendour,\u0027 sings Lord in Bhagavad Geeta. Thus the term is interpreted as the Lord Whose one ray of glory was the Kamsa-employee, the Yaadava-Akroora.",
      "\n**Pesalah**\n\u0027One who is supremely soft.\u0027 In His Infinite Kindness and Mercy, His Heart-divine is ever flowing out in love and tenderness towards His devotees when they call out for help ardently and lift themselves from their body-consciousness and ego-centric life of sense-pursuits.",
      "\n**Dakshah**\nThis term stands for the quality of \u0027promptitude.\u0027 In army training, the Sanskrit command Daksha is equal to \u0027attention alertness, vigilance and utter preparedness to act immediately with supreme urgency.\u0027 All these are implied in that pose of \u0027 Attention.\u0027 The Lord is \u0027Daksha\u0027 in serving the world and in rushing to His sincere devotees. Omnipotent and divinely Efficient in His Infinite Smartness to reach and help all, at all times, everywhere, under every circumstance is echoed in the charming suggestions of this chosen term in the Sahasranaama of Sree Narayana, the Self in All.",
      "\n**Dakshinah**\n\u0027One who is most liberal.\u0027 The term\u0027 Dakshina\u0027 is popularly used for the \u0027gift\u0027 presented to the priests after a ritual as their fee. This giving must be done in a spirit of large-hearted, liberal charity-so that very large-heartedness of mind (Daakshinya) itself is the Lord, as it is the opposite of selfishness and attachment to the wealth which one possesses. \u0027One who has Infinite Kindness and Charity towards all good people and One Who is thus ever- ready to liberally give away His endless Benevolence\u0027 is Sree Narayana, the Dakshina.",
      "\n**Kshaminaam-varah**\n\u0027One Who has the greatest amount of patience with the sinners and forgiveness for their sins.\u0027 Sree Narayana is more patient than even the Earth which is generally pointed to as an example of highest patience (Kshamaa). He exhibits supreme patience with the evil-minded, with the tyrant, the foul and the fiendish. Hiranyaksha, Hiranyakasipu, Ravana and others of this type were given many fair opportunities to realise for themselves the folly of their baser attitudes to existing things and their immoral ways of life. It is only when no other method of treatment could cure them that the Lord destroyed them in His infinite kindness.",

The Lord, the very Consciousness illumining all bosoms simultaneously everywhere, is the One Knowledge Absolute, the Knower of all knowledge of all wise men. Omniscient-Infinite Truth is Sree Narayana as He is Pure Knowledge by the Light of which all \u0027Knowledge\u0027 is known.",
      "\n**Veeta-bhayah**\n921. –\u0027One who has lost all fears.\u0027 Fear can come only from the sense of \u0027other.\u0027 In Advaita Reality, there cannot be any fear as He is the \u0027One- without-a-second.\u0027 The state of Narayana-Consciousness is declared in all scriptures to be\u0027 Abhaya\u0027-the Fearless State.",

This statement of fact is never investigated deeply by students so they generally understand its superficial and obvious meaning only. By \u0027hearing\u0027-with attention-to the stories of the Lord- we must get ourselves involved in the \u0027listening\u0027 and thereafter we must reflect upon the glories of the Lord (Bhagavat Guna) and thus expose ourselves to those recreative thoughts. Not only is it sufficient thus that we imbibe the qualities spiritual, but we must learn to get ourselves committed to the life of God- centred activities. This is called true keertana-singing His Glories. It is not to be a mere noisy chanting of hymns, a mere muttering of mantras; we must teach ourselves to allow Him to express through us. Our physical activities, mental feelings and intellectual thoughts must all shine forth the awareness of His Divine Presence that is in us at every moment, every- where. The life of such a deyotee will itself become, in its dynamic beauty, love and devoted tenderness, a constant worship (poojaa), a continuous (akhanda) hymn chanted (keertana) in praise of the Lord-of-the-heart.\n"

On lifting our attention from the giddy changes in these whirls of finite matter, when we fix it upon Him, the one Consciousness that illumines all changes in all living creatures, we get uplifted into a state of Immortality-Changeless, Blissful, Supremely Satisfying. Hence, Sree Narayana is called as the \u0027Up-lifter,\u0027 the \u0027Saviour.\u0027 The \u0027Taara-mantra\u0027 lifts us from the cesspool of sense living into the serener climes of the lit-up peaks of peace and perfection.",

Perception of plurality is the horrible dream of terrible pangs, consuming fears and drowning sorrows. Dreams are explosions of the suppressions stored away in the subconscious. A real devotee exists in utter surrender unto the Lord. When his life is ever-centred in Narayana-smarana, in such total and humble dedication he has no chance of earning these suppressions. Since his sub-conscious mind is not loaded with half-digested thoughts and unexpressed intentions, repressed desires and suppressed motives, immoral passions and covetous inclinations, he has no fearful dreams in his daily sleep. Ultimately each seeker will rise above his little ego and its hungers and enters into the plane of Narayana-Consciousness.",

Earlier, the technique of anger was explained that when a desire is unfulfilled, anger rises in a man\u0027s heart towards a desire is unfulfilled, anger rises in a man\u0027s heart towards the obstacle between him and his desire.

Sree Hari, therefore, is of the form of Poorna-Aahuti -in the sense that when \u0027total\u0027 surrender of all vehicles and their actions is accomplished, the transcendental experience of the Self, Narayana alone, comes to manifest in all His divine Splendour. Some commentators have, however, taken the meaning of the Yajna-anta-not as \u0027the last item in yajna\u0027 but as \u0027anta,\u0027 the \u0027fruit\u0027 of the yajna by which they bestow the meaning that Narayana is the \u0027One who gives away the \u0027fruits\u0027 for all Hari-dedicated, selfless acts of love and service.\u0027",

      "\n**Annam**\n\u0027One who has himself become the \u0027food\u0027 \u0027 –sense –objects which are the \u0027food\u0027 consumed by the sense –organs. As a verb it can be used as One who \u0027Eats\u0027 the whole universe at the time of the great dissolution. At that time, he is the one in whom the world remains absorbed in the pralaya, just as our individual world each day gets dissolved in our sleep. The one in whom alone the world of names and forms can remain in their \u0027seed-form,\u0027 is Sree Narayana, the self.",

The self, functioning through the \u0027equipment\u0027 is the jeevaatman, the individuality in each of us who \u0027experiences.\u0027 Thus the self is the both \u0027food\u0027 (Annam) and \u0027eater-of-food\u0027 (Annaadah) just as our own waking-mind becomes the \u0027experiencer\u0027 and the \u0027experienced\u0027 in our dream-world.\n"
